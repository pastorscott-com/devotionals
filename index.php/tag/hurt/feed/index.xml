Investing in painful circumstances<br />
Ecclesiastes 7: Sages invest themselves in hurt and grieving.<br />
I know it is human nature to want to hurry past the difficulties of life.  No one wants to spend the rest of their days dealing with some painful situation.  However, I also know that just about everyone has their share of &#8220;hurt and grieving.&#8221;  In fact, some folks have more than their share of such things.  Some of the finest people I know carry a burden of broken health, broken dreams, and painful loss with them every day.  I’ve noticed that, for some, those difficulties somehow deepen them.  They know how to enjoy life, but there’s an attractive stability and perspective on life in them.  The writer of Ecclesiastes says that we’re wise to invest something of ourselves in those challenging parts of life.  When I make an investment, I give something of value because I expect to get a return on my investment.  When I go through the darkness I tend to rush through it as quickly as possible.  This portion of Ecclesiastes reminds me that there’s something for me even there if I’ll trust the Lord enough to give myself to such difficulties.<br />
Take Away: Obviously, no one wants to go through hard times, but even in such times the Lord can work in our lives, deepening us, making us more like his Son, Jesus.</p>

Trying to lock up the wind<br />
Ecclesiastes 8: No one can control the wind or lock it in a box&#8230;as long as men and women have the power to hurt each other, this is the way it is.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure that the writer intends for me to associate these two statements but they tie together for me.  I’ve seen people make bad choices.  If I ask them about it, they’ll most often have someone or something to blame for what they’re doing.  I&#8217;m not saying that everyone else is always innocent in some of these things but the bottom line is that people pretty much do what they want to do.  Sadly, even when I see what’s going on I can&#8217;t force people to do the right thing.  As Ecclesiastes says, &#8220;no one can control the wind.&#8221;  Well, neither can one control the hearts of others.  The very fact that I love people, encourage them, and help them through their darkest hour means that I also give them the power to hurt me.  At some level I have to just let things go and protect my own heart.  As the writer says, &#8220;This is the way it is.&#8221;  When I’ve done all I’ve been allowed to do, and when my heart has been broken, I come to the place where I have to let go and entrust those I &#8220;can&#8217;t control&#8221; to the hands of a gracious God.  He’s able to work through issues if he’s given an opportunity, even after I’ve been removed from the situation.<br />
Take Away: Sometimes we just have to walk away knowing that the more we try to help the worse we’re making things.  Happily, the Lord never has to just walk away.</p>
