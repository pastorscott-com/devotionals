Experimenting on oneself<br />
Ecclesiastes 2: I said to myself, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go for it &#8212; experiment with pleasure, have a good time.&#8221;<br />
One of the experiments of Solomon is to see if pleasure produces lasting happiness.  As a powerful king he has all the resources necessary for this experiment.  He builds exquisite palaces and gardens, acquires an army of servants, amasses enormous wealth, and fills his life with beautiful women.  He reports, &#8220;Everything I wanted I took.&#8221;  Many people at least attempt this approach to happiness, although few have the resources to pull it off.  Because of that, they remain convinced that just a little more of this or that will do the trick.  They think that once they arrive at that point they’ll be truly satisfied.  Solomon, though, does have it all.  Not only that, he goes into this experiment with his eyes wide open.  His verdict?  Solomon says it’s all like collecting smoke.  He’s left empty and even dejected.  He says he worked hard at making it all happen, expecting to arrive at a place of personal happiness and satisfaction.  &#8220;Surely,&#8221; he thought to himself, &#8220;just one more palace, just another million dollars, just the right woman and everything will come together.&#8221;  However, he ends up thinking it’s all a waste of time.   In spite of this ancient verdict of Solomon, we still tend to believe the big lie that not only is pleasure the answer, but that it’s all there really is to life.  It’s no wonder that &#8220;taking up the cross&#8221; is such a foreign language to us.<br />
Take Away: Happiness isn’t found in possessions.  It can only be found by the way of the cross.</p>

God, enjoying life with me<br />
Ecclesiastes 9: God takes pleasure in your pleasure!<br />
I know that a common view of God is that he’s against our enjoying life and that his favorite word is &#8220;no!&#8221;  That is very mistaken.  It’s true that God has a lot of &#8220;no&#8217;s&#8221; for us.  Then again, a loving father has a lot of &#8220;no&#8217;s&#8221; for his children too.  When his toddler picks something up off the floor and is about to put it in his mouth his mom and dad say, in chorus: &#8220;No!&#8221;  Their desire is not to ruin his life, but to protect him from something that might be downright hazardous to his health.  Even so, the Lord has some prohibitions for us and every one of them is for our benefit.  The other side of the coin is wonderfully positive.  When I enjoy some new discovery, or take pleasure in one of God&#8217;s many gifts to me; when I laugh out loud as one of my precious grandchildren comes up with a terrific one liner &#8212; at that moment God laughs with me.   The writer of Ecclesiastes struggles with the meaning of life and is trying to understand just what it is that will bring real satisfaction.  However, he has this one just right: &#8220;God takes pleasure in your pleasure!&#8221;<br />
Take Away: All the joys of life come from our Heavenly Father who takes pleasure in our pleasure.</p>
