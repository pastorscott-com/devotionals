<p>How inspiration works<br />
Jeremiah 36: There were also generous additions, but the same kind of thing.<br />
Babylon isn&#8217;t the only threat to Judah during Jeremiah&#8217;s ministry.  Egypt also invades and conquers the nation.  Jehoiakim is made king of Judah by the Egyptian conquerors.  It’s during his years in power that the Lord tells Jeremiah to write down a recap of all the prophecies that have been made concerning Israel and Judah.  Jeremiah obeys, dictating his messages to Baruch, who serves as his secretary.  The prophet sends Baruch down to the Temple to read it all to the people and the message creates uproar.  Before long, Baruch, scroll in hand, finds himself before king Jehoiakim.   The king, though, isn&#8217;t impressed with Jeremiah&#8217;s message.  As Baruch reads, the king takes a small knife and trims away each column as it’s heard.  He then, in an act of rejection, throws what has been cut off into the fire.  When Baruch returns to Jeremiah and tells him what’s happened, Jeremiah starts all over again, dictating another message from God, this one more elaborate than the first.  Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot here, but I find myself thinking about how God brought about the Sacred Writings that make up our Bibles.  In this case, God doesn&#8217;t dictate a message to Jeremiah to dictate to Baruch.  Instead, the Lord just tells Jeremiah to write down a summary of all the prophecies he’s given concerning Israel and Judah.  Jeremiah goes to work, dictating to Baruch who faithfully writes down what he hears.  The real kicker to me is that when this process is done a second time, we&#8217;re told that Jeremiah adds some stuff to it.  In other words, there isn&#8217;t just one way for this scroll to be written.  The Lord wants Jeremiah to tell the story, and I have no doubt that the Lord helps Jeremiah remember many specifics.  However, for the second round, Jeremiah wants to add some stuff.  It isn&#8217;t that he’s making things up; he just remembers more and decides to include it.  We have here a pretty neat example of how the Scriptures were given to us.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t dictate word for word (that is, unless it says he did).  Instead, he says, &#8220;write about this event or tell the message you received from me.&#8221;  From there, the writer’s free to frame things in his own words and even from his own perspective.  Because of that we hear from the Scriptures not only the &#8220;big message&#8221; of God&#8217;s intentions, but also the &#8220;little message&#8221; of how the writer views the world.  If you think about it, that&#8217;s a pretty good example of how God works in this world: partnering with humanity and even accepting some of our limitations.<br />
Take Away: The Lord wants us to partner with him in what he’s doing in the world.</p>

Please stand for the reading of God’s Word<br />
Nehemiah 8: He read it…from early dawn until noon…and all the people listened.<br />
With the Temple rebuilt and the walls providing security to the city a special gathering is scheduled. Ezra the priest stands on a specially constructed platform to read the Word of God. For three hours he reads as the people stand in honor of the Sacred Word. As Ezra reads, something powerful is happening in the lives of his listeners. In some church traditions time is set aside every service for the reading of and hearing of the Word. This isn’t the same as listening to a sermon, even if it&#8217;s well preached and faithful to the meaning of the passage being considered. This is hearing the Word simply as the Word and letting God minister his grace through it. There is, I believe, a place for the reading and hearing of Scripture in every church. We might have to shorten the singing a bit (or just lengthen the service) to make more room for Scripture. Most of us church folks claim to be &#8220;people of the Word.&#8221; Perhaps we should practice what we preach and give the reading of and listening to God&#8217;s Word a more prominent place in our services.<br />
Take Away: The Word of the Lord is powerful – life changing – and we need to spend a significant amount of time letting it be drawn deeply into our lives.</p>

The favorite Psalm<br />
Psalm 23: God, my shepherd!<br />
Some portions of the Bible are like the peaks of a great mountain range.  It’s all awesome, but there are passages that take our breath away.  There are the beatitudes and the Lord&#8217;s Prayer; in fact, the whole Sermon on the Mount.  Then there’s John 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 13. Also, there’s the great Hymn of Creation of the opening pages of our Bibles.  And there’s the 23rd Psalm.  Here we find such beauty and such comfort and encouragement that we return again and again, especially in times of pain or fear or grief.  I’m reminded today that David wrote it as God, the Holy Spirit, carried him along.  The words are those of an experienced shepherd.  The concepts are inspired by the Lord.  This favorite Psalm is, then, the result of a cooperative effort between God and man.  This mountain peak Psalm is not simply a product of David&#8217;s creativity and it’s not the result of the Lord acting unilaterally as he did in Creation (in other words it isn&#8217;t a result of &#8220;God said &#8216;let there be a Psalm&#8217; and there was a Psalm!&#8221;).  As surprising as it is, the Almighty forms a partnership with a man and the result is Psalm 23.  In this I see not only how God desires to work in this world, but also the great potential in such a partnership.  As I cooperate with God in my life he works with me to bring about wonderful results.  What happens may not be exquisite poetry like Psalm 23, but it will be something of value to the Lord and to me.<br />
Take Away: It’s an unlikely and wonderful partnership – the Lord working with, in, and through human beings.</p>
