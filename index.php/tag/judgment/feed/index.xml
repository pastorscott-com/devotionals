Like an eagle circling high above<br />
Isaiah 32: Weep and grieve until the Spirit is poured out on us from above.<br />
Isaiah is addressing the women of his society, warning them that Judgment is coming and telling them that when it comes their comfortable lives will be disrupted. The coming danger isn’t just that of invading armies but of crop failures resulting in famine in the land. Everything will be turned upside down on that day which Isaiah specifically says is just a little over a year away. With such a storm bearing down on them Isaiah says there’s just one thing to do: repent and seek God. The coming disaster isn’t some random event. It’s the Judgment of God. It’s not too late for them to change their ways and seek the Lord. Earlier, the prophet pictured God as a mighty eagle, circling high in the sky, not waiting to pounce upon some unwitting prey, but waiting to deliver. Now, he says that if sinning, God-rejecting people will repent of their sin the Lord will pour his Spirit out upon them from above. We often think of the prophets as having messages of only gloom and doom but that’s only a portion of their work. In this passage we see an abundant measure of hope for even the most God-rejecting life. To this day, the Lord waits for us to look up in repentance and trust that he might pour his Spirit out on our lives.<br />
Take Away: Like a circling eagle, the Lord hovers over us, waiting for an opportunity to dish out abundant mercy.</p>

Good old Agur Ben Yakeh<br />
Proverbs 30: There is no God&#8230;I can do anything I want!<br />
Some of the final pages of Proverbs are attributed to Agur Ben Yakeh.  Aside from the name and that he is from a town or country called Massa we’re pretty much in the dark about him.  The name, I’m told, doesn’t appear to be Israelite, but is more Arab sounding.  Of course, Solomon rules a vast empire and has friendly relations with many countries.  It may be that Agur Ben Yakeh is considered to be a very wise man in his home country and that Solomon agrees, collecting his sayings and including him in his book of Proverbs.  However, there’s a bit of a problem with this idea because the nation of Israel alone worships Jehovah God at this time.  Clearly, the words of Agur Ben Yakeh are those of a worshiper of God.  I know these little things are often of more interest to me than to others, but it is kind of fun to think about this ancient mystery.  If the identity of Ben Yakeh is mysterious, his opening proverb is pretty straight forward.  He isn’t impressed by people who doubt the existence of God.  They may think they can ignore God and his commandments but when they do it isn&#8217;t the commandments that get broken!  The wise man says &#8220;every promise of God proves true.&#8221;  He warns those who doubt that to reconsider, warning, &#8220;he might take you to task and show up your lies.&#8221;  The day’s coming when everyone will believe in God.  After all, we’ll stand before him in Judgment.  Those who doubt will be convinced, but for them, it will be too late.  The One they have doubted and ignored, will &#8220;take them to task.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: Sooner or later everyone will believe in God – it’s better to be part of the “sooner” crowd.</p>

The weeping prophet<br />
Jeremiah 4: My insides are tearing me up.<br />
If Jeremiah was a modern film maker this portion of his writings would be rated &#8220;R&#8221; for violence.  In one disturbing scene after another he describes the utter destruction that’s coming.  Adam Clarke says this is &#8220;imagery scarcely paralleled in the whole Bible.&#8221;  Jeremiah’s not untouched by his own prophecy.  We don&#8217;t know exactly how this word of the Lord came to him, but if it was in a dream, it was a nightmare and if it was a vision it was a very disturbing vision indeed.  He reports &#8220;I&#8217;m doubled up with cramps in my belly &#8212; a poker burns in my gut.&#8221;  I can&#8217;t say that Jeremiah is my favorite Hebrew prophet to read, but his humanity does draw me in.  Jeremiah didn&#8217;t want to be God&#8217;s spokesman in the first place.  However, he accepts the Lord&#8217;s appointment and his journey begins.  When he sees the coming destruction he isn&#8217;t a disconnected reporter.  Instead, he’s part of the story.  As wave after wave of visions of destruction wash over him he’s sick to his stomach.  He says to the Lord, &#8220;How long do I have to look at the warning flares, listen to the siren of danger?&#8221;  All he wants is out of this.  As a &#8220;proclaimer&#8221; of God&#8217;s Word in my generation I need some of his spirit.  Otherwise, I (and other Christians) sound hard and hateful and am easily rejected by the very people who must hear the message.  If I can interact with lost people without being moved by their plight something’s wrong with me and I need a spiritual transfusion from this &#8220;weeping prophet.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: Judgment, when it must be preached, must be preached with tears in our eyes.</p>

Commanded by God not to pray<br />
Jeremiah 11: I don&#8217;t want you praying for this people.<br />
In Jeremiah 11 the literary style changes from mostly poetic to mostly prose.  God has a talk with Jeremiah about his ministry.  It’s here that Jeremiah is given a frightening command.  God says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t pray for these people&#8230;I&#8217;m not going to listen.&#8221;  I find that command as chilling as icy wind on a bleak winter day.  Grace has been withdrawn and hope is dead.  God says to them, &#8220;I have pronounced doom on you.&#8221;  Once that bridge has been crossed it&#8217;s too late to pray.  The Lord explains to Jeremiah that there are things happening beyond his view.  Jeremiah says, &#8220;I had no idea what was going on&#8221; even concerning schemes against him, personally.  In this case the withdrawal of grace is for a specific people and time.  Later on Jesus makes it clear that God&#8217;s grace is available to &#8220;whoever believes.&#8221;  On one hand, my realization of this brings me a sense of relief and I&#8217;m glad that I don&#8217;t live in a &#8220;don&#8217;t pray for these people&#8221; time in history.  On the other hand, I&#8217;m reminded that there are clouds on the horizon.  Personally, we each are promised a day when we’ll breathe our last and our future will be sealed.  Beyond that, at a time &#8220;we do not know&#8221; the curtain of God&#8217;s grace is going to fall on history.  What I do with the offer of grace now will make an eternal difference then.<br />
Take Away: It’s foolish to treat our relationship with the Lord with anything short of a sense of urgency.</p>

Facing an uncomfortable truth<br />
Jeremiah 16: I&#8217;m getting rid of you.<br />
Any time I hear an argument that casts doubt on the existence of a literal hell I’m drawn to it. When I encounter a thoughtful point against the doctrine, well, I can&#8217;t help but listen.  It isn&#8217;t that I&#8217;m afraid of going there.  After all, my faith is firmly placed on Jesus, my Lord and Savior.  It&#8217;s just that I instinctively shy away from the idea of people suffering forever.  As soothing as it might be for me to land on the &#8220;no hell&#8221; side of the debate, passages like this block my way.  Here, Jeremiah describes the wrath of God in clear and frightening terms.  Jeremiah is to reflect God&#8217;s attitude in his actions: when destruction comes he isn&#8217;t to attend funerals or offer words of comfort.  In fact, the Lord says that the destruction will be so complete that there’ll be no one left to mourn over the dead.  This passage isn&#8217;t intended to teach me about hell, and it’s likely that common beliefs about it are more folk theology than biblical.  However this passage does teach me something about the Almighty.  God has the authority and the power to judge as he sees fit.  I’ve concluded that, when it comes to God&#8217;s love, I can never comprehend the greatness of it.  Today, Jeremiah reminds me that the same can be said when it comes to my comprehension of God&#8217;s hatred of sin.<br />
Take Away: The Lord has the authority and the power to judge as he sees fit.</p>

Knowing the future<br />
Jeremiah 25: Once the seventy years is up, I&#8217;ll punish the king of Babylon.<br />
It&#8217;s pretty clear to me that the prophets like Jeremiah are mostly involved in proclaiming God&#8217;s message to their contemporaries.  However, once in a while they do what we often associate with the ministry of the prophets: telling the future.  This prophecy doesn’t contain hidden terms and double meanings.  Instead, it&#8217;s a clear statement about the future.  God is angry, Jeremiah says, and the new king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, is going to be used to bring judgment on the people of Israel.  That judgment will last for seventy years.  After that Babylon itself will be judged.  In this message Jeremiah’s naming names and setting dates.  Some people say this is an example of God seeing the future, but I think it’s better understood as God telling what he&#8217;s going to do in the future.  After all, if the Almighty says he&#8217;s going to do something I can take it to the bank.  I think there’s much about the future that hasn’t been foretold because God hasn&#8217;t set a specific agenda for it.  Mainly, he wants me to trust him and believe that no matter what happens he’ll see me through.  I also think that the big themes are already decided; some very specifically and some in more general terms.  For instance I believe that Jesus is coming back, the dead will be raised, Judgment day is sure, and everyone will spend forever somewhere as a result of that Judgment.  I don&#8217;t need to sweat the details any more than Jeremiah has to detail every single event leading up to the judgment of Babylon, over seventy years in the future.  He’s given an outline of the future and that’s what he tells.  I also have an outline of the future, though it’s not as specific as was Jeremiah’s.  My responsibility is to prepare for that future, and to live through the unknown details of every day with an eye toward the known &#8220;big day.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: We don’t know all the details of the future but we do know about the big stuff – and it’s the big stuff that we’d better get ready for.</p>

A broken yoke (and I’m not talking about eggs here)<br />
Jeremiah 28: You&#8217;ve talked the whole country into believing a pack of lies.<br />
The Lord instructs Jeremiah to make a wooden yoke for himself.  We don&#8217;t see many yokes in our part of the world but they’re still common in many places.  A yoke is a device used to harness an animal for the work of pulling something.  Jeremiah follows the Lord&#8217;s direction and makes a yoke for himself.  It’s used as an illustration for his sermons, calling for people to yield to Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and accept his authority.  Those who do that will be allowed to live in their own land, although they’ll be under the dominion of Babylon.  A competing prophet, Hananiah, has a very different message.  &#8220;Everything’s going to work out just fine,&#8221; he says, &#8220;God’s going to rescue us.&#8221;  When Jeremiah comes around wearing his yoke, Hananiah takes it off of Jeremiah and breaks it to pieces, saying that this symbolizes what’s going to happen to Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dominion of the region.  This, of course, is the message many people want to hear.  They want to believe that in spite of their sin and rebellion against the Lord they’re still his favorites.  They believe they have the &#8220;trump card&#8221; of God&#8217;s promises to their ancestors Abraham and Moses and David and everything will be okay.  Soon Jeremiah returns with a new message.  &#8220;If you can shrug off a wooden yoke the Lord’s replacing it with an iron one.  Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.&#8221;   It&#8217;s not smart to mess with God&#8217;s symbols.<br />
Take Away: We might be able to shrug off unpleasant messages from the Lord, but doing so will ultimately just make things worse.</p>

Playing “let’s make a deal” with God<br />
Jeremiah 34: The army of the king of Babylon has pulled back&#8230;but not for long.<br />
One of the many acts of rebellion against God committed by Judah is that of making slaves of their fellow countrymen.  God forbade this from the very beginning of their existence as a nation, even as they came up out of Egyptian slavery.  Indentured servitude, yes – slavery, no.  With things falling apart as Babylon&#8217;s army’s about to take the city of Jerusalem King Zedekiah frees all the salves.  It appears that he’s playing &#8220;let&#8217;s make a deal&#8221; with God.  In fact, the Lord seems to agree to the deal.  Nebuchadnezzar withdraws his army and for the time being Jerusalem is spared.  At this point Zedekiah does a stupid thing.  He reneges on freeing the slaves.  Those who have been set free are put back into slavery.  The result is quite predictable.  Once again Jeremiah comes forward with a message from the Lord.  He says God’s going to set Zedekiah free in the same way: free to face war and destruction; to face the wrath of God expressed through a foreign king. Nebuchadnezzar will return to Jerusalem to finish what he started.  I don&#8217;t think it’s ever wise to make deals with God.  Sometimes, I think God sees us as we see a child who promises to keep his room clean the rest of his life if we let him stay up to watch a favorite TV show.  We know the child can&#8217;t keep his side of the deal.  In general, though, God expects us to keep our word.  Zedekiah should have stayed with his move to make things right.  In failing to do so, he became, not only a law-breaker once again, but a liar too.<br />
Take Away: The Lord expects us to keep our word.</p>

Walk like an Egyptian<br />
Jeremiah 44:  The good is gone.<br />
The survivors of the destruction of Jerusalem not only flee to Egypt, they embrace the idol worshipping culture of their nation of refuge too.  It isn&#8217;t that big a step.  They were already toying with such things before, although before fleeing Jerusalem they had kept a dash of Jehovah worship mixed in with their religious practices.  Now that Jerusalem&#8217;s destroyed and they&#8217;ve deserted that place they think they&#8217;re free from God Almighty too.  They embrace all things Egyptian.  The popular thing to do is &#8220;walk like an Egyptian.&#8221;  Meanwhile, God&#8217;s anger toward them increases.  Back in Judea when everyone else was either being killed off or carried off to live the rest of their lives in Babylonian exile these people had been spared.  &#8220;Blest&#8221; is probably too strong a word, but it&#8217;s clear that they were treated less harshly than were their fellow Israelites.  Their response: run the opposite direction, away from their homeland and away from their God.  So, again, God&#8217;s fed up with them.  If they like Egypt so well, they can have it along with the judgment that&#8217;s coming to that land.  God says to them, &#8220;It&#8217;s all over; I have nothing good left for you.&#8221;   I&#8217;m not a gloom and doom preacher but passages like this concern me.  We Christians are so quick to embrace the current cultural fads.  We&#8217;re entertained by the same things, buy into the same materialistic values, and, in general, fit into the broken culture of our day.  The Lord tells those who fled to Egypt that, if they like Egypt so well, he’ll treat them as he&#8217;s going to treat the Egyptians.  Maybe we Christians ought to think twice before we get too carried away with &#8220;walking like an Egyptian.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: We’re in the world but we’re not to be of the world.</p>

A lesson in humility<br />
Jeremiah 49: I, God, say so, and it will be so.<br />
Chapters 46 through 51 of Jeremiah are a compilation of prophecies Jeremiah gives about the nations of the region.  Clearly, the Almighty is interested in more people than just those of Israel.  He&#8217;s been paying close attention to the downward spiral of the region and is about to shake everything up.  Clearly, this isn&#8217;t as drastic as the Flood was in Noah&#8217;s day, but it is a remaking of this entire region.  Jeremiah writes it all out as poetry: awful, frightening words put to verse.  It&#8217;s in the message to the Ammonites that I find the phrase, &#8220;I, God, say so, and it will be so.&#8221;  To me, that pretty much sums up these painful-to-read chapters.  This is an aspect of the Lord that makes me uncomfortable.  Frankly, I don&#8217;t like these chapters.  Then again, I don&#8217;t have to.  Sovereign God, the Giver of Life, surely has the authority to be the Taker of Life.  What he does along these lines is on his side of the equation, not mine.  He doesn&#8217;t have to explain himself to me and I don&#8217;t have to like how it all works out.  I find some consolation in the fact that the very words I read today are warnings to these nations, given before the fact.  In theory, at least, their turning to God might have resulted in a display of his mercy.  Instead, these people live evil lives and are addicted to cruelty.  In bringing Judgment on this region the Almighty is acting unilaterally and he doesn&#8217;t need my approval and support.  Today as I remember who God is and who I am I find myself learning a lesson in humility.<br />
Take Away: When the Lord acts according to his own Sovereignty we can simply accept it – after all he doesn’t need our understanding, permission, or approval.</p>
