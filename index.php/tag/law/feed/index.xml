<p>Rules and regs </p>
<p>Galatians 2: If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Years earlier the council at Jerusalem came to a momentous decision. While it was okay for Jewish Christians to continue to observe the Jewish rules and regulations the burden of keeping those rules wouldn’t be placed on the Gentile believers. That was a very big deal, but it wasn’t the end of the subject. Some of the “rule keeping” Jewish Christians refused to accept that decision. Off they went to the Gentile churches to “re-educate” the new Christians. Their brand of Christianity was quite Jewish. Beyond that, even Jewish believers like Peter tended to walk on both sides of the road on this one. Around Jews they were very Jewish, but when they were with non-Jews, they relaxed and conducted themselves as though it is, indeed, faith in Jesus that alone makes a person right with God. Paul and Peter had a bit of a falling out about it when Peter, who had been getting along just fine with the Gentile Christians, quietly withdrew from them when a group of rule keeping Jewish Christians showed up. Clearly, in spite of the fact that there had been an official ruling on the matter, in practice, things were still up in the air. Paul, in this case, doesn’t appeal to the Jerusalem ruling, but, instead goes straight to the cross of Christ. He reminds his readers that if rules did the job, then the Jews, of all people, would be happily satisfied with their situation. He also tells them, that, if that was possible, then Jesus would have never gone to the cross. After all, his message to us isn’t “try harder and you’ll be fine.” Rather, his message is that he is the “way, the truth, and the life.”</p>
<p>Take Away: Even if we somehow managed to keep all the rules we’d still be unsaved outside of Christ.</p></p>

<p>Freedom harnessed </p>
<p>Galatians 5: Love others as you love yourself.</p>
<p>Freedom isn’t free.  For one thing, it’s expensive to obtain.  That’s true on national levels.  Wars are fought and lives are lost for the cause of freedom.  It’s also true on the spiritual level.  Jesus goes to the cross, giving his all to set us free from the dominion of sin.  Freedom is also difficult to retain.  Again, on national levels, once freedom is gained it’s often under attack from without and within.  Vigilance is necessary if freedom is to be retained.  Otherwise, it will gradually erode and be ultimately lost.  Paul warns his readers that spiritual freedom must be guarded and allowed to mature.  In his case, some are urging the Christians at Galatia to exchange some of their freedom in Christ for Jewish rules and regulations.  He tells them that if they do that they&#8217;ll be “cut off from Christ” and “fall out of grace.”  He also explains that freedom will actually destroy itself unless it’s harnessed.  Otherwise, freedom becomes destructive and, in the name of freedom, people tend to “bite and ravage each other…annihilating each other.”  If freedom is to survive it must be harnessed, placed under some controlling principle and authority.  The Apostle doesn’t leave us to figure this out for ourselves, but plainly states that authority: “love others as you love yourself.”  Spiritual freedom, then, might be thought of as rather fragile.  On one side, it can be choked off by rules and regulations that seem to draw us like moths to a flame.  On the other side, it can, itself, become a negative, destructive force that causes pain and ultimately consumes itself.  The only hope is for our freedom to be placed under submission to love. It’s no wonder that Jesus, who paid the ultimate price to obtain our freedom insisted that his followers love one another.  Otherwise, what he obtained for us is ultimately lost by us.</p>
<p>Take Away: Even freedom as great as it is must be made a servant to love.</p></p>
