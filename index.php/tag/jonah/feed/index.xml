Not thinking too highly of ourselves<br />
Nahum 1: A report on the problem of Nineveh.<br />
Nahum gets the job Jonah wanted.  Around 100 years earlier God sent Jonah to preach condemnation to Nineveh, but in hopes that they would repent and be spared.  Jonah would have been happy to preach the message of God’s judgment if that was all there was to it.  Now, two generations later Nahum is given that message.  “The problem of Nineveh” is that the Assyrian empire is the superpower of the region.  The tiny nation of Judah is in fearful awe of that empire and behind every move they make is the question, “Will this be okay with the powers that be in the Assyrian capitol of Nineveh?”  Nahum’s call from God is to reorient the priorities of Judah.   He’s to tell his people that God is still God and that Nineveh will be held to the same standards as the other nations of the world.  The prophet goes to work proclaiming his message.  In the first part of his sermon he reminds them that, as mighty as Assyria might be, the Lord is the “All-mighty.”  God’s a patient God, but, in the end, he’s also Judge of the world.  To him, Assyria is just another nation and they’re about to be called to account for their abuse of power.  My nation is on the Assyrian side of things.  We’re the superpower and, to borrow an old saying, “when America sneezes the whole world gets a bad cold.”  As I read from the little Book of Nahum I’m reminded that in God’s eyes we’re not as big a deal as we think we are.<br />
Take Away: It’s important for us as individuals and as a nation to remember that the Lord is the “All-Mighty.”</p>

Why Nahum preaches to the wrong congregation<br />
Nahum 3: You’re past the point of no return.<br />
One hundred years earlier the reluctant prophet Jonah had been ordered to go and preach destruction in Nineveh.  The result was repentance and God changing his mind about destroying them.  Nahum isn’t instructed to go to Nineveh but he&#8217;s given a similar message of destruction.  His sermons appear to be directed to Nineveh but his audience is Judah.  One reason for these anti-Nineveh sermons being preached in Judah is that the people of God are more concerned about what Assyria and its capitol Nineveh is doing than they are with trusting the Lord.  They need to be reminded that, even though they see Assyria as a mountain of power that God sees it as just another anthill.  The second reason for this seeming “preaching to the wrong crowd” is what&#8217;s said in this verse.  In Jonah’s day the Lord hoped to spare Nineveh.  They were great sinners even then, but, according to the Lord, they were more ignorant than rebellious.  Because of that, the Lord was more than willing to change his mind and spare them if they would but turn to him in repentance.  Here in Nahum’s day that has changed.  He preaches about a nation that has pushed God too far and, for them, judgment has come.  Nahum preaches sermons against Nineveh for the sake of Judah.  He doesn’t preach them in Nineveh because it’s too late for them to repent.  I guess the lesson for today is that as long as God speaks to our hearts, even if what he says is guilt producing condemnation, there’s still hope for us.  It’s when we no longer hear from him that it’s too late.  Isaiah put it this way: “Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near.” (Isaiah 55:6 )<br />
Take Away: As long as God speaks to our hearts there’s still hope.</p>
