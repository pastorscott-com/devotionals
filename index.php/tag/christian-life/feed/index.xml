<p>A secret to the victorious Christian life </p>
<p>Ephesians 4: I don’t want anyone strolling off, down some path that leads to nowhere.  </p>
<p>God never calls people to be half-hearted, costing along, distracted followers.  He’s given us everything we need, in fact, abundantly more than we need to live victorious Christian lives.  With this in mind we’re to take it all and run with it.  There’s no need for fits and starts, stumbling and struggling back to our feet.  Rather we’re to confidently move forward on our spiritual journey.  Some folks don’t get it.  Rather than moving forward they wander along, taking detours in which they’re in real danger of totally losing their way.  So, how can I best get on and stay on track?  The Apostle frames it in terms of relationships.  He describes the victorious Christian life as one filled with “acts of love” and in which things that strain our connection to our brothers and sisters in Christ are quickly recognized and resolved.  After all, he reminds us, we’re traveling this road together and we’re connected in our mutual love for our Master, Jesus.  If I fail to love and allow little things to fester in my relationships with God’s people, I become one of those half-hearted, distracted Christians who are in danger of wandering so far from the path that I become lost in the darkness.</p>
<p>Take Away: We really do need each other.</p></p>

Living as one of God’s people<br />
Exodus 22: Don’t be stingy as your wine vats fill up.  Dedicate your firstborn sons to me.<br />
If anyone thinks the Law given at Mount Sinai is all about the Ten Commandments or at least is filled with regulations concerning their religion they need to spend some time in the second half of the Book of Exodus.  The regulations stated here are a mulligan stew of civil, personal, and religious rules and regulations.  The Lord’s just as interested in telling them how to settle a property dispute as he is in telling them how to conduct a worship service.  For instance, he tells them that as they prosper in the land he&#8217;s giving them that they’re to live generous lives.  Then, in the very next sentence he tells them that they’re to dedicate their firstborn sons to him.  For these people, there’s to be no difference between their “religious” lives and their “secular” lives.  Instead, they’re to live their “whole lives” under the authority of God.  Refraining from eating the meat of some dead animal they find in the field and making sacrifices only to the Lord God are both filed under the heading of “be holy.”  A lesson for me in all this is that my life as a whole is to be lived under the authority of the Lord.  I’m to live a generous, honest, compassionate life.  Not only am I to dedicate my children to the Lord, but, as my “wine vats fill up” I’m to be a generous person, sharing the blessing the Lord has given me.  The two, secular and religious, are really just one, living as one of God’s people.<br />
Take Away: My entire life is to be lived as a person of God.</p>
