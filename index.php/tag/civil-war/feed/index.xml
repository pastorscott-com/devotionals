War games aren’t fun<br />
2 Samuel 3: The war between the house of Saul and the house of David dragged on and on.<br />
Sadly, Saul&#8217;s death and David&#8217;s return to Israel isn’t the end of Saul&#8217;s story. His general, Abner, makes Saul&#8217;s son, Ish-Bosheth king over Israel. Meanwhile, David has moved to Hebron in the area of Judah. He’s made king there. Israel’s now divided, with the larger part being ruled by Saul&#8217;s son and the smaller area ruled by David. The result is civil war. David no longer needs to run. He has an army equal to that of Israel. Because of that both sides jealously defend their territory. This is civil war at its ugliest, with relatives battling one another. One major battle takes place at the Pool of Gibeon, where the armies meet face to face. In a deadly game, representatives from each side are pitted against one another in one-on-one fights to the death. As David&#8217;s men win one round after another things escalate to a major battle in which fighters from each side can call one another by name. It is ugly, ugly, ugly. Civil wars are the worst wars in which people who know one another and share common interests and goals fight it out, leaving corpses scattered across the battlefield. There’s nothing more tragic than war within the family. Church people should do everything possible to avoid such wars. The problem is that, as happened at the Pool of Gibeon, such wars start with much smaller barbed &#8220;games&#8221; of saying two edged things to one another or giving or taking offense easily. Oh, how we need the grace of God in our relationships with one another.<br />
Take Away: We can more skillfully hurt those closest to us – so dealing with these precious ones must be especially flavored with grace.</p>

They told me men shouldn’t have long hair<br />
2 Samuel 19: O my son Absalom, Absalom my dear, dear son!<br />
The battle between those loyal to Absalom and those loyal to David is a fierce one, but it’s apparent that David&#8217;s forces are winning. Twenty thousand soldiers fall that day in bloody one-on-one fighting in the most tragic kind of war: brother against brother. Absalom flees but in an ironic twist of fate, it’s his hair, apparently his most prized feature, which brings about his downfall. As his mule gallops under a tree his hair is entangled in the branches. He hangs there, helpless before his enemies. Knowing that David has forbidden the killing of his son, some are afraid to act, but one of his generals, Joab, kills him and then others join in making sure he is dead. When word comes to David his heart is broken and he mourns the death of his son. To Joab and maybe to us this is downright silly. Absalom murdered his brother, tried to take his father&#8217;s throne and life, and is responsible for the deaths of twenty thousand good men. Still, David is deeply saddened by the failure of his son &#8212; possibly thinking of what might have been. I think David&#8217;s response to Absalom&#8217;s death is a reflection of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s sadness over the wasted lives of those who live in rebellion against him. He mourns the spiritual failure of those who have followed Absalom&#8217;s example to tragic ruin.<br />
Take Away: The Lord wants all people to be saved – and, actually, it’s not as though any of us deserves to be saved, it’s all by his love and grace.</p>
