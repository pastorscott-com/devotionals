Free will and accountability<br />
Isaiah 8: No, we’re going to study the Scriptures.<br />
While telling of future events wasn&#8217;t the major job of most prophets, it’s the one we immediately think of when we think of the work of the prophets.  Actually, these men of God mostly &#8220;forth-told&#8221; rather than &#8220;fore-told.&#8221;  Even when they speak of the future it’s often spoken of in a conditional way: &#8220;If you do this, then that will happen; if you do that, then this will happen.&#8221;  In fact, a major theme of these men of God is to remind the people of their free will.  That doesn&#8217;t mean God is helpless, but it does mean, at least in this context, that the Lord allows people the freedom to decide, and then makes them accountable for their decisions.  As Isaiah goes about proclaiming what’s coming if these people stay on the road they’re on, people say to him, &#8220;When I want to know what&#8217;s coming, I&#8217;ll go to a fortune teller or hold a séance.&#8221;  Isaiah says, &#8220;If you want to know what’s coming, take a look in the Scriptures.&#8221;  He isn’t saying that the Scriptures contain some kind of secret road map to the future.  Instead, he’s saying that there’s plenty of evidence in the Scriptures that God won’t forever put up with their foolishness.  Repeatedly, in the Scriptures, the Lord has warned them and it doesn&#8217;t take some supernatural experience to see what’s coming.  Talk about a timeless truth, this is one!  Today, I don’t need a fortune teller.  There&#8217;s plenty of information already available to me in the Bible about how God responds to sin and rebellion.  If I insist on ignoring God I don&#8217;t need a crystal ball to know what’s coming.<br />
Take Away: The Bible is quite clear as to the intentions of the Lord.</p>

Dual level preaching<br />
Isaiah 9: For a child has been born &#8212; for us! The gift of a son &#8212; for us!<br />
Sometimes the prophet does exactly what we generally think of a prophet doing: he speaks of the future.  Isaiah says that even when oppressors come and seem to destroy everything that God will have the last word.  That Word, Isaiah says, will be in the person of a Child who can rightly be called names like &#8220;Strong God&#8221; and &#8220;Eternal Father.&#8221;  Have you ever wondered about the state of mind of men like Isaiah when they speak words like this?  Does Isaiah see it all: manger, shepherds, and wise men?  Or does he scratch his head and wonder why he just said that?  I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.  I can give a very minor personal example of what I mean.  A few weeks ago I was delivering my Sunday morning sermon and found myself emphasizing something that had originally been only a minor part of my sermon.  Such an event is hard to describe to people who haven&#8217;t preached, but I think most everyone who has carried on spiritual conversations have, at times, experienced something similar.  Honestly, as I thought about that sermon and remembered who was in the congregation I had the idea that maybe the Lord wanted to encourage a good person who was going through some challenges in their life.  Still it never crossed my mind to &#8220;aim&#8221; that portion of the sermon at anyone.  I was surprised that I had pursued that point as far as I did.  A few days later, with no thought of that sermon, I was praying and dealing with what I thought was a totally unrelated issue.  Suddenly, the words that I had said on Sunday morning came back to me and I realized that on an entirely different level they were meant for me!  At that moment, the &#8220;deeper meaning&#8221; of what I had said became real to me.  I think that prophets like Isaiah operate at that level when they speak of things like those in Isaiah 9.  Had you had a frank conversation with Isaiah about his promise of the &#8220;gift of a son&#8221; I think he would have plugged it into some current situation in his nation.  That isn&#8217;t to say he was ignorant of there being more than he could grasp, but that, for him, these words applied right then and there.  Only as God&#8217;s plan is played out does the greater meaning of the old prophet&#8217;s words come to light.<br />
Take Away: Even when we think we know what’s going on we’re often surprised to later realize that the Lord was working at levels beyond our grasp.</p>

Looking to the distant future<br />
Isaiah 11: The whole earth will be brimming with knowing God-Alive, a living knowledge of God ocean-deep, ocean-wide.<br />
Isaiah doesn&#8217;t spend all his time looking to the future but when he does, he does it big time.  He describes not only a 700 year distant future and the coming of the promised Messiah, but an even more distant future, thousands of years ahead.  That future is my future too.  People generally think that they have to go to the book of Revelation to look forward, but here in Isaiah we are also able to turn to the end of the story.  It ends with a world that knows God.  That &#8220;knowing&#8221; is anything but superficial.  It’s as deep and wide as the ocean.  Here we not only get a profound look forward, but a look backward as well.  This is our purpose, God&#8217;s intention when he walked with Adam in the Garden.  He desires a deep and intimate relationship with human beings who are the crowing act of Creation.  Even as Isaiah describes the strong medicine that’s coming to his generation, he gives a glimpse of what that medicine is intended to accomplish.  In this case, it’s to move people one step closer to what the Lord created humanity for in the first place.<br />
Take Away: From the beginning our purpose has been to know the Lord and to live in a deep relationship with him.</p>

Grabbing the gusto, looking to eternity<br />
Proverbs 1: When you grab all you can get, that&#8217;s when it happens: the more you get, the less you have.<br />
As I read this passage I can&#8217;t help but think of the beer commercial that tells us we only go &#8217;round once in life so we&#8217;d better grab all the gusto we can.  I actually think there’s some truth to that.  Life is a gift of God filled with many wonderful opportunities and blessings.  I can&#8217;t sit around talking about &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; and get the most out of my life.  There&#8217;s a lot of living to do right now.  The wise man of the Proverbs, though, gives me the other side of that coin.  If I make my life completely about living in the here and now, ignoring all that is yet to come, well, I&#8217;m setting myself up for a great fall.  Life is more than &#8220;right now.&#8221;  This life might be considered to be a warm up for eternity.  So, grabbing the gusto can make sense, but that approach must be kept on a leash and not allowed to just run wild because there’s much more to our existence than just going &#8217;round once.  Or, as Jesus says in Matthew 6:20, &#8220;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: One way to live the best life possible in the here and now is to live with an eye on eternity.</p>

Only God can speak of the future with certainty<br />
Isaiah 14: Exactly as I planned, it will happen.<br />
The topic is still the downfall of mighty Babylon.  The very subject likely sounds like so much wishful thinking to many.  After all, Isaiah is talking about an unstoppable world power that dominates the entire region.  Any suggestion that Babylon will come crashing down must be an excursion into fiction.  Still, that’s Isaiah&#8217;s message.  Even though no power on earth can challenge this mighty army, a Power above earth has it in His sights.  Now, some have used this passage as a proof that God has either fully mapped out the future or somehow travels through time or even exists in all of time at once.  I accept the possibility of the first, but can&#8217;t see the &#8220;time travel&#8221; versions.  For one thing, everything we know about God is what he’s told us or shown us about himself.  We might read something in the Bible and conclude that God did it, or knew it, because he &#8220;looked ahead in time.&#8221;  However, to do that is to come to our own conclusions, and not because we’ve been given a Biblical insight about God.  Well, so much for the &#8220;time travel.&#8221;  The first suggestion is that God mapped it all out.  As I said, I believe that’s possible.  That is, I believe the Almighty has the power and authority to do just that.  The problem for me isn’t in that arena at all.  Instead, it’s that such a view destroys the possibility of free will.  In other words, God could map everything out, but he can&#8217;t plan it all and still grant free will to human beings.  That leaves me with a view of God that concludes he &#8220;could&#8221; have designed a universe in which he could travel through time, but we have no evidence that he did and that he could have written the entirety of Creation out on day one, but he couldn&#8217;t have done that and given human beings anything greater than the illusion of free will.  So what do I do with a passage in which God says things will happen as he planned?  I’ll simply accept it.  Babylon has displeased the Almighty who says, &#8220;Because you have acted as you have, I’ve decided just how I’m going to do away with you.&#8221;  Things will happen to Babylon as God has said because God is going to bring it to pass.  It’s not because he’s already seen it, looking into the future or because he intended, from the beginning, for Babylon to fail as it will.  Rather, it’s God, in Sovereign authority, declaring what he is going to bring to pass.<br />
Take Away: It’s fun to think about the nature of time and the foreknowledge of God, but we’d better not get too theologically invested in our musing.</p>

Living in the “right now”<br />
Isaiah 43: Forget about what’s happened; don’t keep going over old history.<br />
This passage was especially meaningful to me several years ago when I was going through a major change in my life. At the time, I was dealing with some “baggage” from the past even as I prepared to move forward. As I read this portion of Isaiah the Lord seemed to highlight these words. I needed to focus on what God was doing right then and move forward into that. This passage inspired me to look forward with confidence. The Lord was about to do a new thing and he was going to let me be a part of it. How about you? Is there something from your past that needs to be forgotten? If so, let the Lord help you to do that. The place to start is to refuse to keep thinking about it. “Don’t keep going over old history.” Every time it comes to mind, reject it. Then, replace those memories by concentrating on the “new thing” God is doing in you and through you. Live in what God is doing right now rather than in some past disappointment.<br />
Take Away: Is there something from your past that needs to be forgotten?</p>

God keeps his word<br />
Isaiah 44: From the beginning, who else has always announced what&#8217;s coming?<br />
These pages of Isaiah are some of the most encouraging in the whole Bible.  God has such good news for his people.  Salvation is coming to their spiritually dry lives like streams flowing into a parched desert.  This promise is so great that people can hardly get their minds and hearts around it.  To help them do that, the Lord puts his credentials on display.  He says he&#8217;s the first and the last and &#8220;everything in between.&#8221;  He’s always trustworthy and he&#8217;s the one who can speak about his future actions with absolute certainty.  I know some see this passage as ammunition for &#8220;God&#8217;s knowledge of the future&#8221; discussions but it’s more correctly seen as &#8220;God keeps his word&#8221; material.  The Lord isn’t passively watching events unfold and he’s not letting history proceed in whatever direction it happens to find.  This God is on purpose in his dealings with Creation.  As he speaks to a fallen Israel he has promises to make.  Salvation will come because he’ll keep his word.  How does God know salvation will come?  He knows it because he’s going to do it.  Generations later, God&#8217;s promise is kept in a stable in Bethlehem.<br />
Take Away: The Lord is the only one who can speak of the future with absolute certainty.</p>

The prophet&#8217;s description of future events is as powerful a passage as there is in the Bible.  His words are so clear that we tend to just &#8220;blend&#8221; them in with the contemporary accounts from the Gospels of the crucifixion of Jesus as though Isaiah is another Gospel writer.  This, though, is an amazing description of an event hundreds of years before it happens.  What a picture it is: God&#8217;s chosen one, the Savior, being brutalized; ripped and torn and crushed.  Isaiah&#8217;s description causes us to wince and maybe to turn the page to something else.  However, if the picture of horror he paints for us is greatly disturbing, the reason for it is even more disturbing.  The Messiah, our Hope, is suffering in this horrible way for our sins: for my sins.  As hymn writer John S. B. Monsell put it, &#8220;My sins, my sins&#8230;oh how sad on Thee they fall.&#8221;  Isaiah saw it in all its terribleness.  He also recognized it for what it was.  Our sins, my sins, are the reason for it all.<br />
Take Away:  Why did Jesus suffer as he did?  For an answer, look in a mirror.</p>

Knowing the future<br />
Jeremiah 25: Once the seventy years is up, I&#8217;ll punish the king of Babylon.<br />
It&#8217;s pretty clear to me that the prophets like Jeremiah are mostly involved in proclaiming God&#8217;s message to their contemporaries.  However, once in a while they do what we often associate with the ministry of the prophets: telling the future.  This prophecy doesn’t contain hidden terms and double meanings.  Instead, it&#8217;s a clear statement about the future.  God is angry, Jeremiah says, and the new king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, is going to be used to bring judgment on the people of Israel.  That judgment will last for seventy years.  After that Babylon itself will be judged.  In this message Jeremiah’s naming names and setting dates.  Some people say this is an example of God seeing the future, but I think it’s better understood as God telling what he&#8217;s going to do in the future.  After all, if the Almighty says he&#8217;s going to do something I can take it to the bank.  I think there’s much about the future that hasn’t been foretold because God hasn&#8217;t set a specific agenda for it.  Mainly, he wants me to trust him and believe that no matter what happens he’ll see me through.  I also think that the big themes are already decided; some very specifically and some in more general terms.  For instance I believe that Jesus is coming back, the dead will be raised, Judgment day is sure, and everyone will spend forever somewhere as a result of that Judgment.  I don&#8217;t need to sweat the details any more than Jeremiah has to detail every single event leading up to the judgment of Babylon, over seventy years in the future.  He’s given an outline of the future and that’s what he tells.  I also have an outline of the future, though it’s not as specific as was Jeremiah’s.  My responsibility is to prepare for that future, and to live through the unknown details of every day with an eye toward the known &#8220;big day.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: We don’t know all the details of the future but we do know about the big stuff – and it’s the big stuff that we’d better get ready for.</p>

Looking into the future<br />
Jeremiah 43: He&#8217;ll set up his throne on the very stones I&#8217;ve had buried here.<br />
I don&#8217;t believe that the future is mapped out in detail because I firmly believe God has given us the gift, and responsibility, of free will.  However, I certainly believe that some things about the future are preordained.  It isn&#8217;t that the Lord has looked into the future and seen things happening; it&#8217;s just that he&#8217;s Sovereign and he&#8217;s declared he&#8217;s going to bring certain things to pass.  When the Almighty says he&#8217;s going to do something, that&#8217;s just as sure as if it already happened.  In this passage we find Jeremiah in Egypt.  I&#8217;m not sure why Johanan and the others brought him along.  Apparently, it&#8217;s similar to why King Zedekiah kept Jeremiah locked up but couldn&#8217;t resist going to him for the latest word from the Lord.  Jeremiah&#8217;s message to them is unwavering.  The Lord said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go to Egypt&#8221; and they&#8217;ve gone to Egypt anyway.  The Lord said, &#8220;If you go to Egypt you&#8217;ll find the death and destruction you&#8217;re fleeing.&#8221;  Now, Jeremiah drives that point home by having some stones laid along the walkway that leads to one of Pharaoh&#8217;s palaces.  He says that the day&#8217;s coming when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will sit his throne right on top of those stones as he claims the gem of Egypt for Babylon.  Again, I don&#8217;t see every detail of the future as predetermined.  Still, there&#8217;s plenty that God has already declared to be certain.  For instance, Jesus is coming back, Judgment day is sure, and everyone will spend forever somewhere.  I have the freedom to prepare for those certainties or not, as my future isn’t predetermined.  By the grace of God that much is up to me and my eternity hangs in the balance based on that decision.<br />
Take Away: Certain things about the future are sure but how I respond to the grace of God in preparing for that future he leaves to me.</p>
