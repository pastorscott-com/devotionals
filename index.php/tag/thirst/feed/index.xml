Isaiah 12: Joyfully you&#8217;ll pull up buckets of water from the wells of salvation.<br />
As I read this statement from Isaiah about drawing &#8220;buckets of water from the wells of salvation&#8221; I can’t help but think of Jesus and the woman at the well.  Jesus offers the Samaritan woman &#8220;living water&#8221; that she might &#8220;never thirst again.&#8221;  As I see Isaiah promising a day when abundant &#8220;salvation water&#8221; will be available and remember Jesus offering just such water, well, I can&#8217;t help but focus in on this wonderful offer.  I&#8217;m glad today that Jesus didn&#8217;t just offer a philosophy of life or a new approach to religion.  Instead, his &#8220;well of salvation&#8221; contains that which is &#8220;living&#8221; and fully satisfying.  Whether Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy really applies here or not, it does remind me of all Jesus has made available.   In the words of the woman at the well, &#8220;Give me that living water that I might never thirst again.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: The “living water” is nothing other than an abiding relationship with the Lord, himself.</p>

The real thing<br />
Isaiah 55: Hey there! All who are thirsty, come to the water!<br />
I like to drink my share of coffee and enjoy a diet Dr. Pepper once in a while.  But when I’m really thirsty, I reach for a glass of water.  Nothing quenches my thirst like a glass of cool, sparkling water.  Spiritually speaking, there’s thirst-quenching water.  I can turn to a million substitutes that promise satisfaction, but they’ll all let me down.  For some reason, though, I tend to turn to almost anything but the Real Thing.  No, I&#8217;m not talking about Coca-Cola!  Into the market place of life Isaiah comes, shouting out his message of hope to those who’ve tried everything else yet are still dissatisfied with life.   His message reminds us that there’s a genuine Source of satisfaction.  That Source isn&#8217;t a &#8220;thing.&#8221;  Rather, it’s a &#8220;Person.&#8221;   Are you thirsty?  Come to the water.  His name is Jesus.<br />
Take Away: Only Jesus, the “living water,” satisfies the soul.</p>
