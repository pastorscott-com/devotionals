<p>Intentionally or not, the disciples did the right thing</p>
<p>Matthew 17: His appearance changed from the inside out, right before their eyes.  Sunlight poured from his face.</p>
<p>To some extent I don’t think the Church has ever fully grasped the Person of Jesus.  It took hundreds of years for the doctrine of the Trinity to be established and it’s been “official” now for over 1600 years.  Still, if you talk to some people they’re still back in the early years of Christian theology and not convinced at all that the Trinity doctrine has it right.  When we think about the Person of Jesus there’s always a tug a war between “he’s God” and “he’s man.”  In the pages of the Gospels we watch Jesus, the man.  He grows weary and sleeps, he gets thirsty, and he bleeds.  We also watch Jesus, the Lord.  He forgives sins and tells his disciples that he and the Father are one.  In this passage, as Jesus takes three disciples up on the mountain, the humanity of Jesus is overwhelmed by this divinity.  The disciples see it as light that pours out of him.  This isn’t the Jesus they ate supper with last light.  This isn’t the Jesus who slept through the storm.  This is God.  Peter, James, and John don’t know what to say or do as they experience this Jesus.  Still, maybe by instinct, they do the right thing: they fall flat on their faces in reverence and awe.  Know what?  This radiant-light-pouring-out-of-his-face Jesus is just as much Jesus as the hungry, sleepy, dying-on-the-cross Jesus.  Falling down in worship before him is an excellent response.</p>
<p>Take Away: We may struggle with the person of Jesus, but worshiping him is always the right response.</p></p>

<p>My brother is King</p>
<p>Hebrews 2: It’s logical that the savior took on flesh and blood in order to rescue them by his death.</p>
<p>Once the awful persecution of the ancient Church ended, it turned its attention to formalizing the doctrines of Christianity. What beliefs are required to be “Christian” and what beliefs are outside of the boundaries of Christianity? Creeds were debated, created, and adjusted as Christians tried to better understand what was and what was not “Christian.” It’s no surprise that the main focus in all this was Jesus, himself. Who was he? What does it mean for him to be the “Son of God”? What does it mean for him to be the “Son of man”? Some people focused on his humanity and decided Jesus was a very good man who was picked by God to be the Savior of the world. Others focused on his divinity. They decided that Jesus appeared to be human, but was actually God dressed up in human flesh. Ultimately, the Church abandoned mathematics in favor of faith. It was concluded that Jesus was, at the same time 100% man and 100% God. Never mind that this adds up to 200% &#8212; we’d just believe that that’s how it is. Here we are, way down the road and so comfortable with this approach that we don’t think much about it. Today’s passage played a role in this understanding of Jesus. The writer of Hebrews describes one who was so human that he died a very human and real death for all. At the same time, he’s positioned in the loftiest of realms. For human beings, this is good news indeed, it’s great having one we call “brother” also be our Lord and Savior.</p>
<p>Take Away: Jesus is 100% man. He’s also 100% God. This God-man is the Savior of the world.</p>
