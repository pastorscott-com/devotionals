<p>I’ll see you in court!</p>
<p>1Corinthians 6: Just because something is technically legal doesn’t mean that it’s spiritually appropriate.</p>
<p>One of the bones Paul has to pick with the Corinthians is that some of them have taken fellow Christians to court. He’s shocked, disgusted, and angered that Christians would drag their disagreements to court to be judged by non-believers. For one thing, it undermines the influence of the gospel. For another, it surrenders God’s way in favor of man’s way. Paul labels this action as “stupid.” This, he declares, isn’t the way Christians are to behave. Someone might respond that it’s the only way they can get justice. The Apostle says that being wronged is better than wounding the cause of Christ. It’s on this point that he makes his most powerful argument on this topic: an action might be legal but that doesn’t make it appropriate for God’s people. Out in the world filing a lawsuit might be considered business as usual, but among God’s people doing such a thing is inappropriate. I think it’s sad that Christians ever part ways. We’re supposed to be branded by our love for one another. If it happens though, we aren’t to handle things the world’s way. As Paul points out, surely there’s someone in the body of Christ that both sides respect. Surely they can turn to them for help in straightening things out. If not, sometimes it’s better to take the short end of the stick and trust God with the long term results. I feel compelled to add here that there are times when Christians are dragged into court against their will, or must seek justice in their dealings with non-believers. At such times we have every right to defend ourselves and seek justice in every legal way possible. In fact, Paul does that in the book of Acts. Even then, though, he concludes that his current legal problems are being used of God to advance his Kingdom. Again, though, just because something’s legal that doesn’t mean that, for the believer, its right.</p>
<p>Take Away: God’s people follow a higher way.</p>

I wonder which Internet forum Job visited?<br />
Job 15: If you were truly wise, would you sound so much like a windbag?<br />
Eliphaz&#8217;s second speech is pretty much a repeat of what’s already been said: people who ignore God&#8217;s rules have nothing but trouble.  It’s his response to Job&#8217;s prayer of complaint that’s interesting to me.  Job says that life is unfair and he wonders if there’s something beyond this life where wrongs are made right.  As it is, he says, life for both good and bad people has way too much pain and sorrow.   Eliphaz hates what Job’s saying so he calls him a &#8220;windbag,&#8221; and his words just so much &#8220;hot air.&#8221;  I doubt that Job is all that interested in hearing what Eliphaz has to say after that!  This isn&#8217;t exactly a deep, thoughtful response, but I can&#8217;t help but hear some exchanges between Christians in this.  Job has raised some valid points, but instead of responding to them, even in disagreement, Eliphaz insults him and then repeats what he’s already said on the topic.  That sounds very much like the exchanges I&#8217;ve seen on the Internet.  In person, we’re usually a bit more polite, but the end result is the same.  How do I respond when a fellow Christian brings up a point and comes to a conclusion that I hate?  Do I respond by insulting him and repeating what I&#8217;ve already said?  Do I attempt to understand why he believes as he does?  Eliphaz never imagined an Internet forum, but his style is alive and flourishing today.<br />
Take Away: Learning to really listen to people with whom we disagree is an important part of our spiritual journey.</p>
