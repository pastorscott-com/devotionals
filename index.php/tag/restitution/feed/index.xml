<p>God’s been good to me<br />
Genesis 34: God has been good to me and I have more than enough.<br />
Jacob, now also named Israel, faces his original victim. He was born right after his twin brother Esau and he came out of the womb holding the heel of his brother; apparently trying to get a bit of a free ride! Esau grew up to be a down to earth, hardworking guy and Jacob grew up to be a person who takes advantage of down to earth, hardworking guys. Now it’s time to face the music. Blessed beyond his wildest dreams he, who left home with nothing, returns home with wives, children, servants, and a wealth of livestock. The first thing he has to do is to make things right with Esau. Jacob showers his brother with gifts. Actually, Esau has also done alright. Still, Jacob insists and his reason is the right one. “God has been good to me and I have more than enough.” It’s time to make things right with his brother. Jacob gives God the credit, acknowledging his blessings, and freely shares out of his abundance. Having said all that, I can add my own testimony. God’s been good to me too, and I also have more than enough. How can I use God’s abundant provision in my life to be a blessing to someone today? How about you? How has the Lord treated you?<br />
Take away: How should a blessed person act?</p>

<p>Time doesn’t heal all wounds.<br />
Genesis 42: Now we’re paying for what we did to our brother.<br />
As a famine crushes the region only Egypt, under Joseph’s rule, prospers. Soon, those from the surrounding nations are coming to Egypt, ready to pay any price for grain. In time, aged Jacob sends his sons to Egypt and for the first time in the over 20 years since they sold him into slavery the brothers come face to face with the one they terribly mistreated. When they don’t recognize him, Joseph uses his authority to find out what kind of men his brothers have become. If one of them is put in jeopardy, will they abandon him as they abandoned Joseph long ago? With Simeon held back, the others are free to go. As I hear the conversation they have I’m taken with the enduring and debilitating power of guilt. They say to one another: “Now we’re paying for what we did to Joseph.” The truth of the matter is that all these years they’ve been paying for their terrible deed and dark secret. These are men haunted by their past and I have the idea that through the years they’ve thought or said these words every time some unexpected difficulty rose. People think they’re getting away with something just because no one knows but that’s never true. Not only is it untrue on the big stage, at the Judgment Day level; it’s also true in day-to-day living. In this case it’s a wound that time will not heal and the only resolution is to confess and take appropriate action to make things right.<br />
Take away: Some things never heal until they’re exposed to the light.</p>

I didn’t mean to<br />
Leviticus 4: If the whole congregation sins unintentionally&#8230;they become guilty even though no one is aware of it.<br />
A group of children are playing in the yard when one accidentally knocks another to the ground.  Soon there’s lots of crying, some because of pain and mostly because of anger.  Mom comes to see what’s wrong.  Billy says, “Johnny knocked me down!”  Johnny responds, “I didn’t mean to.”  Mom tells Johnny to apologize to his friend because, intentionally or not, he has wronged him.  In this passage, as the law is given every contingency is covered, including unintentional sins.  God tells them that when they fail at some point, even if they don’t know it at the time, that they’re to take action to make things right.  In this instance, he isn’t talking about making restitution to a neighbor who&#8217;s been intentionally wronged.   Instead, the Lord’s talking about making things right with himself.  Like Johnny, we tend to stiffen and declare that we didn’t do it on purpose.  Our theologians might debate about the level of guilt and work through the definition of sin but they all agree that, intentional or not, failure is an affront to God.  Jesus, when he teaches his disciples to pray, instructs them to ask for forgiveness even as they forgive others.  When I realize I’ve failed the Lord my response isn’t to be a declaration of innocence.  Rather, it’s to be an honest confession and an effort to make things right.  For these ancient Israelites that meant they needed to make an absolution-offering.  For me, it may only require my sincere confession of failure and apology to the Lord.  One thing that won’t work is for me to stiffen up and declare that it wasn’t on purpose.<br />
Take Away: The proper response to a realization of failure is to confess and repent.</p>

Making restitution<br />
Numbers 5: Tell the People of Israel, When a man or woman commits any sin, the person has broken trust with God, is guilty, and must confess the sin.<br />
The book of Numbers is about naming names.  It also contains considerable practical instruction on how this nation of former slaves is going to function as a People of God.  Reading Numbers is not always the most uplifting devotional reading one might do.  However, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing worth reading here.  Instead, we have to do a little prospecting to find the gold.  This statement from Numbers 5 is a good example of that.  Moses explains to the people the true nature of sin; that it is a breaking of trust with God.  It isn’t a mistake and it isn’t human shortcoming.  Rather, it’s behaving in a disloyal way toward God.  Still, there’s hope rather than condemnation here.  In spite of the guilt, there’s the possibility of restoration.  First, the sinner must acknowledge his sin by confessing it.  No excuses are allowed.  The offender must meet the issue head on.  Second, restitution is to be made.  True to the nature of the book, a practical approach is outlined: restore the full amount of the offense plus 20 percent.  The concept is even expanded to include just who is to receive the compensation in extenuating circumstances.  As a person who lives under the New Covenant, I’m not bound by the letter of the Law.  Still, though, the concepts here apply.  To sin is to break trust with God.  The first step to restoration is to acknowledge my failure.  The second is to make things right.  The specific steps to a remedy are different but the concept sounds a whole lot like the Sermon on the Mount.<br />
Take Away: Confession and restitution lead to restoration.</p>
