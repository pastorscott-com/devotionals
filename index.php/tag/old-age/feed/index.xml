Passages<br />
2 Samuel 21: No more fighting on the frontlines for you!<br />
As the story of David&#8217;s leadership begins to wind down we come to a time when things aren&#8217;t all that inspirational. Uprisings are put down; there’s an ugly story of the Gibeonites revenge against Saul&#8217;s descendants, and a series of one-paragraph accounts of significant battles with the enemies of Israel. Of course, for those involved these are all very big deals (especially for those executed by the Gibeonites!). For us, though, they’re just historical events. David&#8217;s army is still fiercely loyal to him but his power as a warrior diminishes with age. When he’s nearly killed in battle his men forbid him from leading the fight as he’s done for decades. He’s simply not up to hand to hand combat anymore and is more valuable as God&#8217;s chosen leader than he is as a soldier. In other words, this is a transitional time for David. His advancing age doesn’t hinder his ability to lead, but it does compromise his ability to fight. For each of us, as it is for David, life has times of transition. Generally, we don&#8217;t like that very well, but circumstances have a way of dragging us forward, even if we’re kicking and screaming all the way. God isn&#8217;t finished with us, but the role we play changes. Let’s be aware of what’s happening and cooperative with God as we move through the various chapters of our lives.<br />
Take Away: As one period of life ends another begins with a new set of challenges and opportunities</p>

Time flies when you’re having fun<br />
1Kings 1: King David grew old.<br />
First and Second Samuel have told us the stories of two kings. The first failed miserably and the second became Israel&#8217;s greatest king. Now we come to the stories of all the rest. All fall somewhere between Saul and David. These “king stories” start with &#8220;King David grew old.&#8221; It’s interesting to be reminded that even great people grow old. Our days are numbered and, while it’s a blessing to live to old age, it isn&#8217;t really much fun to get there! Physically David&#8217;s wasting away. His circulation isn’t good and he’s cold all the time. His aids come up with an interesting solution for keeping him warm at night. They recruit the young and beautiful Abishag who serves as a sort of &#8220;electric blanket&#8221; for &#8220;poor&#8221; old David. It brings a smile to our faces now, but even the Bible writer notes that David&#8217;s advanced years assure that their relationship is purely platonic. The more serious issue for Israel is that there&#8217;s jostling among his surviving sons as to who will to take the throne. Throughout David&#8217;s 40 years on the throne of Judah and then Israel Absalom&#8217;s effort to take the throne has been the only serious threat to Israel&#8217;s stability. Now, King David grows old and national unity is threatened once again. David has just one more thing to do. He has to name his successor. Once that&#8217;s done the burden of leadership will be lifted from his frail shoulders. I can&#8217;t feel sorry for David. He’s lived a robust life. If anyone ever &#8220;grabs the gusto&#8221; it’s David. Now though, even though he’s bigger than life, it’s life (or maybe better, death) that&#8217;s winning. So it is for all of us. There’s only one alternative to getting old and it isn&#8217;t a very good choice. With that in mind, I want to live as large as I can; to serve God right now with all my strength. Then, when my turn comes I want to be able to look back on a life lived all out for God.<br />
Take Away: We only have one opportunity to live our lives enthusiastically for the Lord, let’s not miss this opportunity.</p>

A longing look back<br />
Job 30: How I long for the good old days.<br />
Job&#8217;s longest speech comes after his three friends have had their say.  His comments range from direct replies to their statements to his view of the world and the inequities he sees in it.  A portion of these thoughts are focused on how things have changed for him.  There was a time, he remembers, when he was wonderfully blessed by the Lord, and, he says, &#8220;Everything was going my way.&#8221;  Job handled these blessings well.  Instead of it all going to his head, he became a friend to those who were going through loss or who needed help along the way.  Those were good days, but remembering them isn’t a source of comfort to Job.  Instead, the memories add to his pain as he realizes he’s lost more than wealth and health.  As I read Job&#8217;s story I note that loss comes in a wide variety of forms.  Job is unique because he lost it all at once, but it’s painful to have even a small portion stripped away.  That includes loss of influence, which often comes with the passing of years.  Those who have given their lives in full time ministry aren’t exempt from this.  The day comes when our ideas are no longer sought after and younger voices dominate the conversation about what God is doing &#8220;now.&#8221;  Like Job, it’s natural to &#8220;long for the good old days.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: As time passes so does our influence.  It’s possible to graciously accept that and to simply go on, trusting the Lord with that which is beyond our influence.</p>

Looking back, remaining faithful<br />
Psalm 71: I&#8217;ll keep at it until I&#8217;m old and gray.<br />
David&#8217;s story is one of the &#8220;complete&#8221; stories of the Bible.  We know him as a child and then journey with him through his rich, eventful life to old age.  This psalm is written in his later years and the long shadows of this evening portion of his life are evident in his words.  The early part of the song is retrospective.  David remembers his childhood and God&#8217;s blessings.  Then, skipping his full life, David asks the Lord to continue blessing him in his senior years.  There are no more wars for him to fight, no more giants to be slain, but David is now in a fight that he will not win.  Is God only interested in young, energy-filled people?  Will David, as his vitality slips away, be put on the shelf and forgotten by not only man, but by God too?  David knows that’s not going to happen.  Even as an old and grey headed man he enjoys the faithfulness of God.  These days he isn&#8217;t out taking on the enemies of God in battle, but he has plenty to say.  People need to be reminded of the story of God&#8217;s goodness and they need to know what it means to really worship.  Gray headed or not, David sets out to lift the Lord, showing the way to praise and worship.<br />
Take Away: The way to conclude life is to continue setting an example of trusting and praising the Lord.</p>
