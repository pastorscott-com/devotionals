<p>Faith or works? </p>
<p>Galatians 1: I can’t believe your fickleness.</p>
<p>The Apostle wastes no time getting to his purpose in writing. He states his credentials, reminding his readers that he is “God-commissioned” and then challenges their recent move away from grace and to Law. This, he says, is no small thing. Rather it’s a pivot away from Christ; a rejection of his message of mercy and life transformation. During his time in their province, Paul laid a foundation of faith for them. He avoided “rule talk” and concentrated on “freedom talk.” He knows all about rules and regulations. In fact, in earlier days he was the champion of both. The biggest fans of such things cheered him on, making him their hero. After meeting Jesus, though, Paul rejected all that. Then, as a messenger for Christ, he set out to tell the Good News and in the telling he carefully avoided binding people up with the things that had bound him the first part of his life. Now he hears that many are embracing the old, failed approach and he’s writing to put a stop to it. In his mind one must decide between seeking righteousness by faith or righteousness by works. The first is achieved only in Christ. The second, well, the second is never achieved and bound for failure before it starts. As I begin reading Galatians right off I’m plunged into a discussion about one of the primary concerns of human beings across the ages: just what must I do to be righteous in the eyes of God?</p>
<p>Take Away: Righteousness can never be found in keeping rules.</p></p>

<p>Rules and regs </p>
<p>Galatians 2: If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Years earlier the council at Jerusalem came to a momentous decision. While it was okay for Jewish Christians to continue to observe the Jewish rules and regulations the burden of keeping those rules wouldn’t be placed on the Gentile believers. That was a very big deal, but it wasn’t the end of the subject. Some of the “rule keeping” Jewish Christians refused to accept that decision. Off they went to the Gentile churches to “re-educate” the new Christians. Their brand of Christianity was quite Jewish. Beyond that, even Jewish believers like Peter tended to walk on both sides of the road on this one. Around Jews they were very Jewish, but when they were with non-Jews, they relaxed and conducted themselves as though it is, indeed, faith in Jesus that alone makes a person right with God. Paul and Peter had a bit of a falling out about it when Peter, who had been getting along just fine with the Gentile Christians, quietly withdrew from them when a group of rule keeping Jewish Christians showed up. Clearly, in spite of the fact that there had been an official ruling on the matter, in practice, things were still up in the air. Paul, in this case, doesn’t appeal to the Jerusalem ruling, but, instead goes straight to the cross of Christ. He reminds his readers that if rules did the job, then the Jews, of all people, would be happily satisfied with their situation. He also tells them, that, if that was possible, then Jesus would have never gone to the cross. After all, his message to us isn’t “try harder and you’ll be fine.” Rather, his message is that he is the “way, the truth, and the life.”</p>
<p>Take Away: Even if we somehow managed to keep all the rules we’d still be unsaved outside of Christ.</p></p>

<p>Jesus only </p>
<p>Galatians 3: Anyone who tries to live by his own effort, independent of God, is doomed to failure.</p>
<p>It’s astounding to read the writings of this once exemplary Pharisee as he takes on the failure of rule keeping.  Paul was, at one time, a Pharisee’s Pharisee.  He was cheered for his dedication to a thousand-and-one rules; zealous for that way of life to the point that he hunted down and imprisoned any who threatened it.  Now, years later, he’s making a lawyerly case against that approach, urging his friends at Galatia back from the brink of yielding to a “Jesus-and” approach to God.  When a past Pharisee says rule keeping dooms a person to spiritual failure I’m wise to listen.  Paul says the key to spiritual life isn’t trying harder, rather it’s trusting God more.  He says this secret has always been out there, hidden in plain view.  After all father Abraham is counted as righteous, not because he’s so good at always doing just what God wants (in fact, he’s notoriously bad at it) but rather because he trusts God.  Rather than creating a human powered way to God the rules prove to me once and for all that that approach will never work.  I’m left in a hopeless condition unless a superior way is made available to me.  And that’s exactly what happens.  Jesus, the Son of God, accepts my failure as his own.  What rule keeping can’t do, he does.  The door to righteousness is opened wide.  To surrender to a “Jesus and” approach is to take a step backward to a failed system.  My hope is firmly fixed on “Jesus only.”</p>
<p>Take Away: There’s no other way to God than through faith in Jesus.</p></p>

<p>Freedom harnessed </p>
<p>Galatians 5: Love others as you love yourself.</p>
<p>Freedom isn’t free.  For one thing, it’s expensive to obtain.  That’s true on national levels.  Wars are fought and lives are lost for the cause of freedom.  It’s also true on the spiritual level.  Jesus goes to the cross, giving his all to set us free from the dominion of sin.  Freedom is also difficult to retain.  Again, on national levels, once freedom is gained it’s often under attack from without and within.  Vigilance is necessary if freedom is to be retained.  Otherwise, it will gradually erode and be ultimately lost.  Paul warns his readers that spiritual freedom must be guarded and allowed to mature.  In his case, some are urging the Christians at Galatia to exchange some of their freedom in Christ for Jewish rules and regulations.  He tells them that if they do that they&#8217;ll be “cut off from Christ” and “fall out of grace.”  He also explains that freedom will actually destroy itself unless it’s harnessed.  Otherwise, freedom becomes destructive and, in the name of freedom, people tend to “bite and ravage each other…annihilating each other.”  If freedom is to survive it must be harnessed, placed under some controlling principle and authority.  The Apostle doesn’t leave us to figure this out for ourselves, but plainly states that authority: “love others as you love yourself.”  Spiritual freedom, then, might be thought of as rather fragile.  On one side, it can be choked off by rules and regulations that seem to draw us like moths to a flame.  On the other side, it can, itself, become a negative, destructive force that causes pain and ultimately consumes itself.  The only hope is for our freedom to be placed under submission to love. It’s no wonder that Jesus, who paid the ultimate price to obtain our freedom insisted that his followers love one another.  Otherwise, what he obtained for us is ultimately lost by us.</p>
<p>Take Away: Even freedom as great as it is must be made a servant to love.</p></p>

<p>What God wanted all along</p>
<p>Hebrews 8: God put the old plan on the shelf.</p>
<p>Prior to Christ, the old plan was the only plan. It included laws written on stone, rules and regulations. It was characterized by failure, repentance, and trying harder. It actually never had a chance of setting people right with God and had more to do with letting people who wanted to “do it themselves” find out just how dissatisfying that kind of religion is. All along, the Lord had a superior way in mind. That better way started, not with rules and regulations, but with the Lord taking charge of salvation. His plan all along was to change people’s hearts so that their religion would be less religion and more relationship. There were plenty of hints that this was coming. The revered prophets of old were much more relationship oriented than they were rules oriented. Jeremiah, who&#8217;s quoted in this passage, longed for a day when God’s Law would be written inside a person rather than written on stone tablets. Their greatest king, David, was remembered, not as a man of rules but, instead, as a man after God’s heart. The rules had their place, but now they’ve been replaced by grace through Jesus Christ. Now, the old way is a museum exhibit. The new way is life, itself.</p>
<p>Take Away: Through Christ’s death we have abundant life – something rule keeping could never accomplish.</p>
