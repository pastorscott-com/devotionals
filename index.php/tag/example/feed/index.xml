The Nebuchadnezzar school of leadership<br />
Daniel 3: Anyone who does not kneel and worship shall be thrown&#8230;into a&#8230;furnace.<br />
Any pollster will agree that an opinion freely given is more valuable than one that starts with, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t say this I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;   One response of Nebuchadnezzar to his dream is to build a statue of himself and then command everyone to worship it.  Can&#8217;t you imagine him watching this show and commenting, &#8220;See how they love me!&#8221;  The truth of the matter is that there&#8217;s a lot more self-preservation than love going on in that event.  This is leadership at its worst.  A boss who says, &#8220;Do it or I&#8217;ll fire you&#8221; or a parent who says, &#8220;Do it or I&#8217;ll whip you&#8221; or a pastor who says, &#8220;Do it or God will get you&#8221; is a graduate of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s school of leadership.  In this case, what the king wants is wrong in the first place, but even if what he wanted people to do was clearly the right thing he&#8217;s going about it in the wrong way.  Real leaders lead by vision and example.  People follow because they&#8217;ve made that vision their own and believe that the leader is the person who can help them get there.  Jesus doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Follow me or you&#8217;re going to hell.&#8221;  Instead, he says, &#8220;Follow me and I&#8217;ll make you fishers of men.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: Real leaders lead by vision and example.</p>

<p>Money matters</p>
<p>1Timothy 6: A devout life does bring wealth, but it’s the rich simplicity of being yourself before God.</p>
<p>The final chapter of this first letter to young pastor Timothy is about money. Paul&#8217;s concerned about church leaders who see their position as a way to make some easy money. Timothy&#8217;s warned to identify such people as quickly as possible to keep them from infecting the whole church with their “germs of envy, controversy…” and other equally bad stuff. Timothy, himself, as a man of God, is to pursue, not money, but “wonder, faith, love, steadiness, courtesy.” Finally, Paul addresses how Timothy&#8217;s to deal with those who are already wealthy. He’s to warn them to not be money centered but, instead, to handle their riches in the same way the Lord handles his: with extravagant generosity, helping others out of their bounty. Even though this is a short course on the topic of money and the church we find here a well-rounded treatment of the subject. First, watch out for church leaders who are in it for the money. Second, the pastor must be careful to not get caught up on the pursuit of money. Finally, those who do have money are to handle it with care, letting the generosity of the Lord, himself, be their example.</p>
<p>Take Away: Money doesn’t have to be a curse – rather it can be a way in which we reflect the generosity of the Lord.</p>
