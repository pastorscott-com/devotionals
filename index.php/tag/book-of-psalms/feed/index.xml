Note to my readers:<br />
As most folks know, the Book of Psalms is the longest book of the Bible. It’s also the lynchpin of the Wisdom Literature in Scripture. By their very nature the Psalms are devotional reading. More often than not, as I read the Psalms I don’t need a commentary as much as I need to listen to what’s being said and then find ways to internalize it into my life. Many people do that by reading a Psalm each day as a part of their daily Bible reading. I don’t intend to write a devotional on each Psalm. Instead, I encourage you to spend some time letting the Psalms feed your spirit. Perhaps the devotionals I do write will serve as primer to help you do that.</p>
<p>Chewing on the word of God<br />
Psalm 1: You chew on Scripture day and night.<br />
The book of Psalms is the world&#8217;s finest songbook. For centuries the Hebrew people turn to the Psalms and chant them as a part of their worship. Four part harmony hasn&#8217;t been invented yet, but they have the themes of worship down pat. Not only are the Psalms worship songs, they’re often prayers too. They’re not always high sounding and polished prayers. Often they’re prayers from the heart and they reflect the entire range of human emotion. If I know a few things about harmony and chord progression that the Psalmists don&#8217;t know, I have to admit that the Psalmists know some things about absolute honesty with God that I need to learn. The first Psalm is a simple consideration of  the kind of people God likes. Right at the heart of it is the fact that God likes people who &#8220;chew on Scripture day and night.&#8221;  This goes way beyond doing my daily devotions and reading a bit of the Bible. Instead, it reaches down into my life as I take what I’ve read and consider how it applies to what I’m doing throughout the day. Today, I’m reminded that God likes people who like his Word. That&#8217;s a fine reason to allow it to permeate my life.<br />
Take Away: God likes people who like his Word.</p>

Something better<br />
Psalm 4: I have&#8230;more joy in one ordinary day than they get in all their shopping sprees.<br />
Now here’s a current application of an ancient truth.  Possessions don&#8217;t give true joy but God does.  My society is in love with &#8220;stuff.&#8221;  People stand in line in the cold all night to be one of the first to own the latest toy.  When that expensive bit of plastic is six months old, do they still think it was worth all that discomfort?  I doubt it!  David reminds me that living an &#8220;ordinary day&#8221; in the joy of the Lord is better than having an extraordinary day without him.  The thing is that these people standing in line are doing so because they don&#8217;t know any better.  They think that the latest gadget is the best life has to offer.  When I see them sacrificing so much for so little I’m not to feel superior.  Instead, I’m supposed to feel compassion.  By God&#8217;s grace I know something they don&#8217;t know and I have a commission to somehow show them that there’s something better.<br />
Take Away: Possessions don’t give true joy but God does.</p>

Being real with God<br />
Psalm 6: If you love me at all, get me out of here.<br />
When I spend any time in the Psalms at all (getting beyond the 1st Psalm, the 23rd, and the 100th) I find that they aren’t all about praising the Lord for his blessings and protection.  In fact, there is a lot of heartfelt pain.  In this Psalm David cries out to God, asking the Lord to let up on him.  He says he&#8217;s black and blue and tired of all this!   I find here, not only permission to speak to God frankly, from my heart, but I sense the whisper of the Holy Spirit reminding me that, if I do complain to God like that it had better be the real deal. That is, if I’m really hurting and broken and angry, then God wants me to freely express it to him.  If I’m just complaining though, I need to stop whining.  I need to get on with life; trusting God to see me through.  There’s a big difference between my bringing my brokenness to God, honestly expressing my heart to him, and my just being a wimp who complains to God about every little setback in life.<br />
Take Away: I can be real with God, in fact, I’d better be.</p>

Safe days<br />
Psalm 7: I&#8217;m feeling so fit, so safe: made right, kept right.<br />
Don&#8217;t you just love those &#8220;safe days&#8221;?  What a blessing to look inward and see a heart made right and kept right.  How pleasant it is to think serene thoughts, imagining soft, easy-going days in which I relax in the assurance of God&#8217;s pleasure with my life.  It&#8217;s too bad that that&#8217;s not the message of this Psalm at all.  David is under attack and he&#8217;s running for his life.  He&#8217;s been accused of all kinds of failure, including spiritual failure.  If his enemies get their hands on him he&#8217;s finished.  This isn&#8217;t a day at the beach.  This is war.  And it’s in the middle of this war that David looks to God for help and vindication.  As some of his life&#8217;s most difficult days rage all around him, he looks upward and finds hope.  He looks inward and finds peace.  While I really do love soft &#8220;safe days&#8221; I know that the real test of God&#8217;s work in my life is out on the battle field.  If I can sense his pleasure with me and find inner peace there, well, I can find it anywhere.<br />
Take Away: Life isn’t always easy but the Lord is with us and in us even on hard days.</p>

Perspective<br />
Psalm 8: Why do you bother with us?<br />
In all of life there’s a need for balance and in Psalm 8 we’re given a nice example of this.  On one hand, I&#8217;m a mere speck in the Universe, practically invisible in comparison to God&#8217;s wondrous Creation.  Honestly, sometimes I get this and sometimes I don&#8217;t.  Rick Warren starts his famous Purpose Driven Life book with the words, &#8220;It&#8217;s not about you&#8221; and I can read that and respond, &#8220;Yes, I know!&#8221;   Other times I get caught seeing things only from my tiny perspective: &#8220;Why are they singing that song again?  I don&#8217;t like it nearly as much as I like the others.  Let&#8217;s sing some southern gospel, that&#8217;s my kind of music!&#8221;  At times like that it doesn&#8217;t hurt for me to remember that the worship service isn&#8217;t really designed for me in the first place.  Still, I know I can go too far with this humility stuff.  Back in the Stone Age of my childhood church kids were taught to say, &#8220;God didn&#8217;t make any junk.&#8221;  I’m valued by the Lord.  Still, once in a while it&#8217;s a good idea for me to look around and realize that everything isn&#8217;t in orbit around me after all and to join David in humbly asking the Almighty, &#8220;Why do you bother with &#8221; me at all?<br />
Take Away: It really isn’t all about me – or you!</p>

Balancing the books<br />
Psalm 10: God&#8217;s grace and order wins.<br />
As did Job, the Psalmist considers the inequities of life.  The wicked say, &#8220;God is dead&#8221; and continue down their evil paths.  The Psalmist seeks God, knowing God is just and tries to understand how a just God can allow injustice to continue.  He concludes that he hasn&#8217;t seen the end of it all yet.  Sooner or later (and he hopes it’s sooner) God’s going to make things right.  When he does, he says, the &#8220;orphans get parents&#8221; and the &#8220;homeless get homes.&#8221;   That doesn&#8217;t mean I become a fatalist who makes no effort to right the wrongs in this world, but it does mean that I don&#8217;t get overwhelmed by it all and give up in despair.  My best efforts will make a difference in the lives of those I minister to in the Name of the Lord, but a day is coming when the Lord will square every account.  God will balance the books.<br />
Take Away: The Lord has the last word in human affairs.</p>

No wonder we’re so happy!<br />
Psalm 16: I&#8217;m happy from the inside out.<br />
David&#8217;s testimony in Psalm 16 is absolutely inspiring.  He makes the decision to run to God, making him Lord of his life and when he does this all the puzzle pieces of his life fall into place.  Because of his trust in God he’s drawn to the best friends he could ever have.  As he chooses the Lord he’s pleasantly surprised that before he ever picked God that God picked him!  Now, day and night, his life confirms his decision and, when the end comes, he knows that his decision to serve the Lord will go with him into the world to come.  It sounds almost too good to be true.  Know what?  It is true: every word of it.  It’s no wonder David has a smile on his face!  I guess that&#8217;s the reason Christians are so joyful too.  After all, our story is every bit as victorious as is David&#8217;s.  In fact, we know more about it than he does.   We have (in Paul Harvey&#8217;s words) &#8220;the rest of the story.&#8221;  We know about the Incarnation, the cross, and the resurrection.  What&#8217;s that?  You don&#8217;t think Christians are all that joyful?  Well, shame on them&#8230;on us&#8230;on me!<br />
Take Away: The people of the Lord have every reason to rejoice.</p>

Seeing God, everywhere<br />
Psalm 19: God&#8217;s glory is on tour in the skies.<br />
God speaks to us in various ways.  When I hear the phrase: &#8220;God&#8217;s Word&#8221; I always assume that it’s the Bible that’s being talked about.  David, who thought of the written word of God as the Torah, reminds me that &#8220;God&#8217;s Word&#8221; is much more than written words making up a leather-bound book or a rare and valuable scroll.  He says that Creation, itself, is the &#8220;Word of God.&#8221;  Whether I am watching the sunrise or a starlit nighttime sky I’m reading God&#8217;s message of love and goodwill to me and to all human beings.  These things, David says, are roadmaps to God&#8230;roadmaps with easy to follow directions.  Of course, beyond the written Word, or the Word displayed in Creation, is the Living Word of God: God the Son, Jesus.  David only has a dim, distant knowledge of the Word in the Flesh.  Still, even lacking that, he keeps seeing God everywhere he looks.  In all of life, God is speaking; I just need to learn to listen on a broader scale that I might more fully hear his message to me.<br />
Take Away: If we pay attention we’ll hear from God in a wonderful variety of ways.</p>

The favorite Psalm<br />
Psalm 23: God, my shepherd!<br />
Some portions of the Bible are like the peaks of a great mountain range.  It’s all awesome, but there are passages that take our breath away.  There are the beatitudes and the Lord&#8217;s Prayer; in fact, the whole Sermon on the Mount.  Then there’s John 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 13. Also, there’s the great Hymn of Creation of the opening pages of our Bibles.  And there’s the 23rd Psalm.  Here we find such beauty and such comfort and encouragement that we return again and again, especially in times of pain or fear or grief.  I’m reminded today that David wrote it as God, the Holy Spirit, carried him along.  The words are those of an experienced shepherd.  The concepts are inspired by the Lord.  This favorite Psalm is, then, the result of a cooperative effort between God and man.  This mountain peak Psalm is not simply a product of David&#8217;s creativity and it’s not the result of the Lord acting unilaterally as he did in Creation (in other words it isn&#8217;t a result of &#8220;God said &#8216;let there be a Psalm&#8217; and there was a Psalm!&#8221;).  As surprising as it is, the Almighty forms a partnership with a man and the result is Psalm 23.  In this I see not only how God desires to work in this world, but also the great potential in such a partnership.  As I cooperate with God in my life he works with me to bring about wonderful results.  What happens may not be exquisite poetry like Psalm 23, but it will be something of value to the Lord and to me.<br />
Take Away: It’s an unlikely and wonderful partnership – the Lord working with, in, and through human beings.</p>

Highs and lows and in-betweens<br />
Psalm 30: I can&#8217;t keep quiet about you.<br />
It’ll come as a surprise to no one, but I confess that I’m no David.  He lives larger than life.  I have the idea he’s more passionate over his breakfast each morning than I am over the biggest events in my life.  When David&#8217;s up, he’s really up, filled with joy and praises and song.  That&#8217;s not me.  The top of his roller coaster ride is far above mine!  I confess that I sometimes envy those &#8220;Davids&#8221; in my life, so full of life and passion.  On the other hand, when David is down, he’s really down!  He doesn&#8217;t stop at being somewhat discouraged, instead, he feels absolutely abandoned.  He isn&#8217;t just frustrated; instead, he’s filled with despair.  The bottom of the roller coaster ride for people with the &#8220;David personality&#8221; is far below mine and when I see them down there in so much pain I confess that I feel a little superior, or at least a bit glad that I&#8217;m not like that.  The neat thing is that God made both of us and he sees something of himself in each of us.  I have a long way to go, but in my personality, and in others who are wired like me, there’s just a hint of God as the &#8220;solid Rock,&#8221; our &#8220;firm foundation.&#8221;  Then, when I am around a &#8220;David&#8221; I see something of God&#8217;s passion and zest.  Of course in God we see it all without the flaws that are associated with the human versions, then in Jesus we see humanity perfected, just as God intended in the first place.  It occurs to me that one purpose of the Psalms is to let people like me hitch a ride with people like David.  I won&#8217;t make it to the top with him and I won&#8217;t have to ride with him to the bottom, but I might be stretched just a little.  That’s a good thing.<br />
Take Away: There’s something of the Lord in every positive personality type.</p>
