As he closes the letter, as Paul does, the writer tosses in a lot of one line instructions. As a reader, what I get out of a chapter like this depends a lot on what\u2019s happening in my life right now. Tomorrow I might read it again and have a different \u201cone-liner\u201d jump out at me. Anyway, the instruction to take our faith out of the church and into the streets stands out to me. Christians are to be generous people who not only respond to needs when we\u2019re confronted with them, but who actively go out and seek those in need that we might minister to them in Christ\u2019s name. I tend to think of \u201cworship\u201d as what takes place on Sunday mornings inside the church building. In this passage I\u2019m reminded that God really likes it when I make my \u201csacrifices\u201d (an Old Testament style of worship) outside the church building and into my everyday life; at home, at work, and out in the general public. In-church worship is important, a vital part of living in Christ. Out-of-church worship is just as important as I take Jesus in practical ways to those \u201cout there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Worship inside the church and service outside the church are both vital parts of Christianity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A different kind of \u201cstreet service\u201d Hebrews 13: God takes particular pleasure in acts of worship\u2026that take place in kitchen and workplace and on the streets.
