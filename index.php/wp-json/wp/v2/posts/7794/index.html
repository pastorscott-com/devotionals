The task before him is a daunting one and there\u2019s real opposition.  Zerubbabel is tasked with following in the footsteps of one of the most famous kings of Israel, King Solomon, who built the first Temple.  During Solomon\u2019s reign, Israel was a powerful and respected nation.  Now, Zerubbabel leads a relatively small number of returned exiles in a land that has hostile elements.  In the language of this passage he faces a \u201cmountain\u201d of obstacles to his completion of this, the greatest project of his life.  However, even though there\u2019s much to stop him, there is even more to assure his success.  The \u201ceven more\u201d is God.  The Lord&#8217;s pleased with his commitment to this task and the Lord\u2019s going to see to it that he succeeds.  My friend, once those words are said there\u2019s nothing more to say and the only thing left to do is to do it.   Through the centuries God\u2019s people have discovered this passage, and many others like it, and have been both challenged and encouraged to do mighty deeds in the name of the Lord.  Not only that, ordinary people like me have applied this \u201cbig mountain, who do you think you are?\u201d approach to dealing with the ordinary, everyday circumstances of life.  As Paul writes to the Church at Rome, \u201cWhat, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: God\u2019s Spirit, in me, makes the impossible possible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nothing more needs be said Zechariah 4: So, big mountain, who do you think you are?
