The immediate assumption of the proverb is that there are those who are, indeed, perishing.  In some cases it\u2019s quite clear that people are in trouble.  Their lives are unraveling and it\u2019s plain that things can&#8217;t continue as they are.  In other cases it takes insight to see what\u2019s happening.  People are living ordinary lives and pretty much keeping things together.  However, spiritually speaking, they too are perishing.  When Jesus stated his mission he gave it in terms of &#8220;rescue&#8221; saying he came to &#8220;seek and to save that which was lost.&#8221;  As I consider this proverb, I\u2019m challenged to join Jesus in that mission.  &#8220;Rescue the perishing, care for the dying.  Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: As followers of Jesus we need to join him in his mission to rescue the perishing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rescue the perishing Proverbs 24: Rescue the perishing; don&#8217;t hesitate to step in and help.
