Still, Job\u2019s sure of this: God knows what\u2019s going on.  Job doesn&#8217;t understand why it is that God doesn&#8217;t immediately make things right (he says &#8220;God does nothing, acts like nothing&#8217;s wrong&#8221;) yet he believes God is a God of justice and that sooner or later the Lord will act.  This is a huge statement of faith for a man who\u2019s experiencing his own &#8220;fate worse than death.&#8221;   Even though the wicked appear to get away with it all Job says that &#8220;God has his eye on them.&#8221;  Even as Job suffers his own personal torment, he still trusts that, in the end, God will make things right.  This is a powerful understanding of the nature of God.<br \/>\nTake Away: We may not understand the here and how but we can understand that, ultimately, the Lord will make all things right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Believing against the evidence in the justice of God Job 24: If Judgment Day isn&#8217;t hidden from the Almighty, why are we kept in the dark?
