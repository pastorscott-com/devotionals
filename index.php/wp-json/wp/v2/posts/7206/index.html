In spite of his being a man with &#8220;lips touched with a coal from off the altar&#8221; his ministry won\u2019t bear fruit.  I know it takes commitment to step forward and say &#8220;send me&#8221; but how much more to go on this mission with the promise of failure.  The Lord says that the people Isaiah goes to minister to will not respond.  Why the Lord tells Isaiah this is a mystery to me.  Why not just send him on without telling him of the failure to come?  I have no answer.  However, I do see one important thing here: I belong to the Lord and I have to leave the results of my ministry in his hands.  For Isaiah the important thing is &#8220;going&#8221; &#8212; being faithful.  That\u2019s how it is for all of us who serve him.<br \/>\nTake Away: We\u2019re called to obedient faithfulness.
