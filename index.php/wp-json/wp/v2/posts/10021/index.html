At first the Church in Jerusalem is skeptical.  They\u2019ve had trouble from the religious powerbase in Jerusalem before and if word spreads that these followers of Jesus are mixing it up with Gentiles there\u2019s bound to be renewed opposition.  However, when Peter tells what happened, especially how the Holy Spirit came to them even as he came to the 120 in the Upper Room those who have been critical of Peter can\u2019t help but praise God.  Their Messiah is, indeed, the Savior of the world!  Such an eye opening and faith-expanding event has come just in time because even as the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem are beginning to grasp the enormity of what Jesus has accomplished things are happening hundreds of miles north of them in Antioch.  The Gospel is being proclaimed and non-Jews are coming to Christ by the hundreds and maybe thousands.  Because of what happened at one house in Caesarea and with just one Apostle, Peter, the Church in Jerusalem is ready to respond to the big thing happening in Antioch.  From a micro point of view, the event at Cornelius\u2019 house is pretty cool, but not that big a deal.  However, God is doing something much bigger, preparing the way for the Good News to spread like wildfire throughout the Mediterranean region.  It is fun to be part of the big deal, but it\u2019s pretty neat to be there when the \u201cbig deal\u201d was still a relatively \u201clittle deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: What a blessing it is to be in on the ground floor of some great movement of God!<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Back at the beginning Acts 11: As it sank in, they started praising God.
