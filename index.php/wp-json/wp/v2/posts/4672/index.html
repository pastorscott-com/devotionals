Walk in the paths he shows you.<br \/>\nThe transition of the throne from David to Solomon will not be bloodless, but considering the day and age, it comes close to it. David calls for Solomon to come to him and they have a father-son (or maybe better, a king-king) talk. Some of what David says is lofty, truly uplifting. He encourages Solomon to walk in God&#8217;s ways. If he does that, the Lord will lead and bless him. Some of what David says sounds cold and calculating. There are some people who have acted in ways intended to promote their own agendas rather than his but for various reasons they\u2019ve never been brought to justice. From his deathbed David lists them for the new king. He doesn&#8217;t tell him what to do in each case but he reminds him that he thinks something should be done. At its worst, this is just plain old revenge. At its best, it\u2019s a cold reminder of reality. This, I think sums up David&#8217;s life. On one hand, he\u2019s a hard pragmatist who\u2019ll unflinchingly kill a man he thinks is a threat to the kingdom. On the other hand, he\u2019s a man who loves God with all his heart, who can write soaring poetry and lift the spirits of all those around him. One thing is certain: there&#8217;s nothing lukewarm about David and that\u2019s abundantly clear in this, his final appearance in the Bible.<br \/>\nTake Away: Let\u2019s let David\u2019s unhesitant devotion to the Lord inspire and challenge us in our own relationship with God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The long arm of the law 1Kings 2: Do what God tells you.
