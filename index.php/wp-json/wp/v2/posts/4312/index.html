Missionaries have them because of their journeys and plumbers have them because they crawl under houses in places where snakes like to live.  I seriously doubt that either group says that encountering snakes is a highlight of their profession.  In this Scripture passage the people anger God by being irritable in spite of his many blessings on them.   In his anger, he sends poisonous snakes that bite people: a death sentence.  Now, there are all kinds of concerns here about our Heavenly Father doing this, and, while I think it\u2019s worthy of consideration, something bigger comes to mind.  You see, spiritually speaking I have been snake bit.  The result is that I\u2019ve been poisoned by sin and the result of that poison is death.  The remedy for the ancient Israelites is the bronze snake on a pole.  When they look up they find healing &#8212; wholeness.  My hope is found when I look to another &#8220;pole&#8221; &#8212; that is, the cross of Jesus.  In him I find, not death, but life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Look up to the cross \u2013 and live!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snakes!
