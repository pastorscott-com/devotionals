Paul\u2019s friends there have some questions about the Second Coming of Jesus and the events associated with it. In fact, his first letter may have been misunderstood resulting in the writing of this second, shorter, more to the point letter. One thing Paul wants to make perfectly clear: Jesus is coming back and when he does there&#8217;ll be no doubt that \u201cthis is it.\u201d Twenty years earlier Jesus warned his followers that people would panic, causing some of them to rush here and there, trying to be at the right place for his return. Now, Paul deals with this same topic. Jesus will appear \u201cin a blaze of fire\u201d accompanied by \u201cstrong angels.\u201d On that \u201cvery same day\u201d he&#8217;ll be exalted and celebrated by those who believe in him. In other words, Christians won\u2019t have to go searching for Jesus and none will be left in the dark concerning his return. As I read these words I\u2019m reminded that those who teach a \u201csecret rapture\u201d don\u2019t necessarily have it right. I\u2019m friendly to the view, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the only way to talk about the return of Jesus. Either way, the most important thing isn\u2019t getting the details all worked out. Rather, it\u2019s being ready. As Paul puts it, \u201cpray that our God will make you fit for what he\u2019s called you to be.\u201d Passing a theology quiz isn\u2019t required for entry into heaven.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: While it\u2019s nice to think one has a handle on some of the more difficult portions of Scripture, it\u2019s even better to live in a right relationship the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No one will wonder whether or not it\u2019s the Second Coming 2Thessalonians 1: He will be exalted by his followers and celebrated by all who believe.
