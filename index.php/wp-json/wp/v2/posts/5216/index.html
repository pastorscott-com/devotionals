Today, I\u2019m reminded that all the good things in life come from the Lord.  He\u2019s the &#8220;Blesser&#8221; giving us so much to enjoy.  One of the lies of the Garden of Eden is that people can pull themselves up to God&#8217;s level and thus &#8220;bless themselves&#8221; in doing things their own way.  The truth is that nothing I do on my own to create a satisfied, happy life equals what God can do for me.  Getting my own way won&#8217;t give me a rich life.  Instead, I\u2019ll have spent my assets on a bag of worthless rocks.  It\u2019s only when I realize that God is the only One who can make my life worth living and that he desires to do just that that I have a hope of living the &#8220;rich life.&#8221;  Sometimes, I have to simply accept God&#8217;s blessings in a sincere spirit of thanksgiving and not try to do it my own way.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord blesses me the proper response is to say \u201cthank you\u201d and then go about enjoying the blessing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I did it God\u2019s way Proverbs 10: God&#8217;s blessing makes life rich; nothing we can do can improve on God.
