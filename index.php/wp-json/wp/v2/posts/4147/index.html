On one hand, he\u2019s an Egyptian and a member of the ruling class at that. On the other hand, he\u2019s a Hebrew, condemned at birth, a member of a nation of slaves. Sooner or later he has to decide who he is. That day comes, even though his expression of solidarity with God\u2019s people is quite flawed. First, he kills an Egyptian who mistreats a fellow Hebrew. He then tries to be a peacemaker between two Hebrews who are having a fight. There\u2019s no question in his mind or in the mind of Pharaoh which side he\u2019s on and soon Moses finds himself fleeing for his life. I\u2019ve heard some sermons about how Moses should have waited for God to call him to be the liberator of his people and that, had he done that, it would have saved him four decades of leading sheep. For all I know, those sermons are right on. Still, I\u2019m taken today with the need to decide early on which side one is on. Moses is likely mistaken when he kills the Egyptian, but his decision to cast his lot with a nation of slaves rather than be a member of the Egyptian royal household is courageous and ought to be appreciated by all who read the story. I\u2019m glad that early on in my life the Lord spoke to my heart and that, right then, I decided to say \u201cyes\u201d to him without over thinking what such a response might mean. Today, I won\u2019t give Moses a \u201cthumbs up\u201d on what he did but I\u2019ll certainly give him credit for why he did it.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sooner or later we need to decide what side we\u2019re on\u2026and the sooner the better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Identity crisis Exodus 1: He killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.
