The final pages are more about words of greeting than theology. Now, almost an afterthought, the Apostle warns his readers about the danger of taking \u201cbits and pieces\u201d of the truth and using them in such a way as to create an untruth. Some people, Paul warns them, are pretty good at doing this bad thing. They take true statements and then twist them to their own purposes. He tells his readers to stay away from people like that. As I read this warning I can\u2019t help but think that one of the best ways for me to avoid this trap is to study God\u2019s Word, making the effort to know what it really says. Another thing that comes to mind is that I don\u2019t ever want to be one of these troublemakers who abuse the Bible, making it say what I want it to say. I can\u2019t help but think that had Paul seen the future and how it would be his own words that would most often be abused in this way that this particular admonition would have been given a more prominent place in this letter. It might have been placed on page one, written in capital letters, rather than being shoehorned between words of greetings here on the final page.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Lord doesn\u2019t take it lightly when people abuse Scripture.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No Scripture abuse allowed here Romans 16: Keep a sharp eye out for those who take bits and pieces of the teaching you have learned.
