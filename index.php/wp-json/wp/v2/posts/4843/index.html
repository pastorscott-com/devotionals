There are fighters who cried out to God and received his help, farmers, potters, and linen workers.  Now, I\u2019m introduced to some professional singers.  These are the song leaders who served during David\u2019s reign.  Here\u2019s choirmaster Herman and his associate Asaph, the writer of some of the Psalms in our Bibles.  These singers were faithful to their assignment and, now we see them included in the list of people in the opening pages of 1 Chronicles.  Music has always been important to the people of God.  David, a song writer and musician himself, didn\u2019t want to take any chances with the worship music of his day so he appointed people to give their full attention to it.  I don\u2019t want to carry things too far here, but it\u2019s good to remember that the music of worship is worth our best effort.  That doesn\u2019t mean that any one style is the right one, but it does mean that our music is an offering to the Lord and we want to give him our best.  Personally, I\u2019m thankful for the talented musicians and singers and song writers who have blessed me and helped me focus on the Lord.  This Sunday it might be a good idea to let these folks know they\u2019re appreciated.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for those who lift our hearts to God through their music.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God bless the singers 1 Chronicles 6: These are the persons David appointed to lead the singing in the house of God.
