The only other Nahash we have in Scripture is a brutal king who was going to partially blind the men of a village in Israel. His threat energized Saul&#8217;s early leadership of Israel. It\u2019s unlikely that the man named in this story is the same one. In some way unknown to us the Nahash mentioned here showed a kindness to David, possibly during his time in exile. David, now settled as king, hears of Nahash&#8217;s death and sends representatives to express his sympathy to his son, Hanun. However, Hanun takes them to be spies. He humiliates them and sends them back to David. This event sets off the war that\u2019s described in this chapter. Although these events happen on a large scale, such things do happen in everyday life too. We try to do the right thing, to be peacemakers, only to be rebuffed. Happily, such things don&#8217;t have to always end in war. Had Hanun not responded as he did, an alliance might have been formed here, similar to what Israel formed with Hiram of Tyre under Solomon. Probably a larger reminder is that even our best intentions can sometimes backfire. My responsibility is to be a peacemaker and, as Paul writes in Romans 12, &#8220;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.&#8221; As we see here, it isn&#8217;t always possible, but it should be our first effort.<br \/>\nTake Away: More often than not it is possible to live a peace\u2026as the people of the Lord we\u2019re to make that our priority.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Peacemaking can be hazardous business 2 Samuel 10: I&#8217;d like to show some kindness to Hanun, the son of Nahash.
