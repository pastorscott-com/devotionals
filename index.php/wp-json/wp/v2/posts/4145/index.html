I\u2019ll pay you.<br \/>\nMoses is not only born into slavery, he\u2019s also condemned at birth. In a callous effort to stem the booming population growth of the Israelites Pharaoh has ordered the execution of all boys born to the slaves. When his mother can hide him no longer Moses is placed in a small basket that will float and hidden among the reeds along the river. His older sister Miriam is given the task of watching over him from a distance. Apparently, the idea is to hide the baby by day and then retrieve him at night. In a surprising twist that is characteristic of the Lord\u2019s work, it\u2019s Pharaoh\u2019s own daughter who discovers the baby. Then, making things even more delightful, quick thinking Miriam offers to find a nanny for the baby. She goes directly to her mother who\u2019s given the job. Instead of seeing her baby murdered, Moses\u2019 mom is paid to raise her own son who&#8217;s now under the protection of the house of Pharaoh! I love stuff like this and, apparently, so does God. He loves taking impossible situations and turning them upside down. As I read this story today I\u2019m reminded that God always has the last word even in the darkest of nights. In my life, it won\u2019t be the writer of my obituary who\u2019ll have the last word \u2013 it\u2019ll be him.<br \/>\nTake Away: God has the last word even when everything seems to be going wrong.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The last word Exodus 2: Take this baby and nurse him for me.
