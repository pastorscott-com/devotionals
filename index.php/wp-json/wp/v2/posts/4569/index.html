The battle belongs to God.<br \/>\n&#8220;This very day God is handing you over to me.&#8221; So says David as he prepares for battle with Goliath.  For us this is a nifty story, one of the most memorable in the entire Bible.  For David, well, this is the real deal.  Before him stands a giant of a man who intends to disembowel him.  David has chosen a sling and some stones as his weapon of choice but he knows this fight isn&#8217;t really about weapons at all. This is a spiritual event, and he correctly identifies it as such: &#8220;I come to you in the name of God-of-the-Angel-Armies.&#8221;  In spite of the real and material threat, David correctly classifies it as a real and spiritual matter.  As much as I like this story, do I really apply it to my own &#8220;real and material&#8221; life?  Am I good at praying and trusting God only in theory or do I do it into practice, where the &#8220;rubber meets the road&#8221;?  Instead of viewing conflicts as spiritual events, do I rush to defend myself &#8212; or call a meeting to plot a strategy for getting my way &#8212; or throw my weight around &#8212; or manipulate the people involved?  To do so is to view the issue at hand as one of &#8220;swords and spears&#8221; rather than as a spiritual battle that belongs to God.  When I do that kind of stuff, I may get my way in the short run, but it will always come at a price to me and to others.  Then again, I may not get my way at all and the giant may just win, leaving me fatally wounded.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s a real challenge to retrain oneself to recognize spiritual battles for what they are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do I really believe the battle belongs to God? 1 Samuel 17: Everyone gathered here will learn that God doesn&#8217;t save by means of sword or spear.
