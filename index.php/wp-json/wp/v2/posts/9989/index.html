After all, it\u2019s the center piece of the gospel message.  Still, since I\u2019ve been here many times before I can afford to shade my eyes and look around a bit.  Somewhere around the third or fourth level of importance I see a bit of a theme here.  Right after the resurrection Jesus reminds the women that he told them that all this would happen.  \u201cThen they remembered Jesus\u2019 words.\u201d  Then, the women to go the disciples with the best news ever told, but \u201cthe apostles didn\u2019t believe a word of it.\u201d  Peter, though, goes to the tomb.  He \u201cwalked away puzzled, shaking his head.\u201d  Later, Jesus himself joins two disciples on the way to Emmaus.  They\u2019re so clueless about everything that he calls them \u201cthick-headed\u201d and \u201cslow-hearted.\u201d  That night Jesus appears to all his disciples at once, but \u201cthey still couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing.\u201d  All of this takes place following the resurrection.  These people, followers of Jesus, his friends, his disciples, his supporters, struggle to get their heads and hearts around what this is all about.  So, I sit here more than 2000 years after the fact reading, once again, the story of the resurrection.  I can draw from a rich tradition of theology, doctrine, and scholarship of the Bible.  Still, I wonder: do I really get it?  Have I gotten so used to the blazing light of the resurrection that I fail to embrace it?  If so, I need to stop everything else and go back to the garden and spend some time there.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: For the resurrection to matter to me I have to take time to get my heart around it and fully embrace it.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Slowing down, looking around the garden Luke 24: So thick-headed!
