Again, this is just stuff that has no major significance but is interesting to think about.  I can&#8217;t help but smile when I realize that the much quoted tribute to a good wife was probably written by a woman!  Still, it is nice to see such positive words about women who love and serve their family; women who make a difference in this world for their loved ones and for God.  After all, if not for this passage, what would preachers use for a text on Mother&#8217;s Day?
