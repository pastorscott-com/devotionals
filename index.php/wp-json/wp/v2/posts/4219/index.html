The Lord intends to make the people of Israel a unique nation on the face of the earth.  Right now the Lord is in the process of setting everything in motion.  In the midst of the detailed plans for the Tabernacle and it\u2019s furnishings I hear an earth shaking promise from God.  He says, \u201cI\u2019ll move in and live\u2026I\u2019ll be their God\u2026they\u2019ll realize that\u2026.\u201d  This concept is both humbling and thrilling.  The Lord isn\u2019t going to sit up on Mount Sinai, distant and unapproachable.  Instead, he\u2019s moving in with them.  Some years ago a joke was going around about churches having a \u201cgolden telephone\u201d providing direct access to the Lord.  The punch line depended on where the joke teller lived.  Of course, for me, Texas was the featured state.  Using the golden telephone in Texas is much cheaper because calling heaven is local call from Texas. In this passage in Exodus we find that the Lord intends that it be a \u201clocal call\u201d when his people call his name.  He\u2019s moving in and has no desire to be beyond our reach.  It\u2019s humbling to think that God Almighty would take such interest in mere human beings.  However, it\u2019s also thrilling to consider that he wants to move into my neighborhood and be an active participant in my everyday life.  For Moses, this is all about the Tabernacle and worship there.  For me it is all about Jesus coming and then sending his Holy Spirit to \u201cmove in and live\u201d in my heart.  \u201cOh Lord, come on in, you\u2019re welcome here.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is as near as my next thought directed to him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s a local call Exodus 29: I\u2019ll move in and live with the Israelites.
