He told them what Jesus taught and did. He told them about the resurrection and the promise of the Second Coming. He also warned them that living for Jesus isn\u2019t always a walk in the park. Actually, Paul\u2019s beaten and bruised body, a result of things getting rather rough in nearby Philippi, was proof of that. They entered the Christian life with their eyes wide open. Now, years down the road, Paul has received word that his friends in Thessalonica are going through some hardship of their own. Paul lays awake at night praying for them; that they\u2019ll make it through. Ultimately, he sends his son in the faith, Timothy, to them with a message of encouragement. The great Apostle wants to give them all the tools necessary to live for Jesus and remain ready for him to come again. Well, Timothy has completed the trip and his report on Thessalonica is better than Paul ever imagined. Timothy hasn\u2019t found a cowed, shrinking group of believers just hanging on trying to stumble over the finish line at Christ\u2019s return. These believers may not be enjoying the hardship that has come, but they\u2019ve never been more in love with Jesus. Their faith has not only survived, it has thrived. Paul is relieved and thrilled. Isn\u2019t it good to remember that the people of God don\u2019t have to live small, pitiful, just-making-it-through lives? We aren\u2019t always going to have an easy journey, but in Christ, we can enjoy his strength; and in that strength, we can be constant overcomers.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The way may not always be easy; but it\u2019s a blessed way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Enduring faith Thessalonians 3: But now that Timothy is back, bringing this terrific report on your faith and love, we feel a lot better.
