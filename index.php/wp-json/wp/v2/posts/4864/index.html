It\u2019s quite instructive to see the lists of, not only the mighty warriors who fought with David, but of &#8220;mighty worship leaders&#8221; as well.  We thank God for those who have the bravery and skill to protect us from those who would harm us.  Such people are worthy of our admiration and thanks.  Here, I\u2019m reminded that those who are gifted and trained to lead me into the Presence of the Almighty are also people worth my deepest appreciation.  Also, I see here that David feels worship services are important enough to merit the appointing and organizing of specific worship leaders.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that those who aren\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d can&#8217;t lead in worship, in fact, they often do.  Some of the finest worship services I\u2019ve ever seen were led by ordinary people with little formal training but who knew something about getting into the presence of the Lord.  Whether a person\u2019s &#8220;on salary&#8221; or not is a poor reflection of whether or not they\u2019re gifted in leading genuine worship.  I thank God for worship leaders who usher us into the presence of the Lord.  Thank God for anointed people.<br \/>\nTake Away: Some people are gifted to lead in worship, thank God for them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anointed worship leaders 1 Chronicles 16: That was the day that David inaugurated regular worship of praise to God, led by Asaph and his company.
