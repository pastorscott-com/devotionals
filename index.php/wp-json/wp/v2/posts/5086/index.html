A tree can be cut down and yet be the source of new life, but Job hasn&#8217;t seen that with human beings.  When a person, good or bad, dies and is buried it appears that it\u2019s the end for them.  Is there a possibility of resurrection?  Job hopes so.  After all, if God is good and yet people who serve him come to tragic ends and that is that, well, something is wrong!  This insight doesn&#8217;t stop Job from his suffering and questioning, but it\u2019s a brilliant insight concerning human suffering.  We may not always see the full picture of God&#8217;s justice and goodness now, but the final chapter of his dealings with human beings isn\u2019t written at the grave.  If God\u2019s justice isn\u2019t seen this side of the grave, it must be seen beyond it.<br \/>\nTake Away: Without Easter Job has arrived at a theology of a resurrection.
