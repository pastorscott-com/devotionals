Through the years I had read the Bible in various translations, used different devotional guides, etc. I felt that rather than reading several pages each day that I needed to slow down and reflect more on what I was reading.<\/p>\n<p>Writing has always been a way for me to think through things. As I prepare sermons I don&#8217;t write a manuscript, but I do a lot of writing which helps me organize my thoughts. I decided I would read my Bible each day until something caught my attention. At that point I would stop reading and write my thoughts about it.<\/p>\n<p>At first, these were strictly personal thoughts and I had no intention of making them public. However, I ultimately decided that by posting them online I would not only be sharing my thoughts but I would have a thumb in my back to keep writing. I ended up posting the devotionals to not only my blog but to Facebook and Twitter as well.<\/p>\n<p>A few years later, I self published my devotionals, ultimately in four volumes. I basically gave them away, setting the prices at the minimum allowed. Several have bought the books, but many more read them daily online.<\/p>\n<p>When I finally came to the end of Revelation I decided to go back to Genesis, repeating the devotionals day by day, sometimes editing them for clarity or just to fix a typo. I think all my devotionals have now been published on a daily basis four times.<\/p>\n<p>On the online version of my devotionals I&#8217;ve added a photo, taken during our travels, to each day&#8217;s devotional.\u00a0 I think I&#8217;ll republish the daily devotionals again, starting in Genesis, because people are just finding them.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to all who have read, made occasional comments, and clicked on Facebook &#8220;like.&#8221; Your words of encouragement are a real blessing to me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2005 I was thinking about ways to enhance time I spent in God&#8217;s Word.
