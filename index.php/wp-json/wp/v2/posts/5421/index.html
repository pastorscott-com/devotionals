I also know that we Americans have a lot to learn from other nations and cultures. Just my limited relationships with friends of Mexican heritage has both broadened my perspective and deepened my life. This passage, however, underscores the other side this issue. If there\u2019s a place for open-mindedness, there\u2019s also a time and place for narrowness and exclusivity. In this passage I hear the Lord speaking words of hope and comfort through his man Isaiah. I see that God offers us the gift of salvation. I also am told he\u2019s the only one qualified to make that offer. I can walk down the aisle of Wal-Mart and decide which brand of peanut butter I prefer. I can listen to presidential candidates and pick which one I want to support. I can realize that the Oriental culture has something to offer that\u2019s just as good as or maybe even better than what my own culture offers. However, when it comes to salvation, there\u2019s only one place to go, and that\u2019s to the God Isaiah\u2019s talking about. The salvation he offers is abundant and sufficient for me and for every other person. Still, I need to know that it\u2019s also the only salvation that actually saves. He\u2019s the only Savior there is.<br \/>\nTake Away: When it comes to salvation, there\u2019s only one place to go.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Only One Savior Isaiah 43: I\u2019m the only Savior there is.
