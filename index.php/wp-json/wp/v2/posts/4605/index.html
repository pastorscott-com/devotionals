Saul, as a young man, was chosen by God, himself, to lead Israel. His very stature dominates a room. Even strong warriors were willing to follow his leadership. This capable man could bring order, peace, and safety to those under his command. But he\u2019s also a deeply flawed man who could hear the direction of God and then ignore it to do what seems best to him at the time. Also, he\u2019s an empty man. When he rejects God&#8217;s authority in his life God rejects him. From that day onward, life drains out of Saul, leaving him just a shell of what he could have been. Now, pursued by his enemies and fleeing in defeat, he meets his end on Mount Gilboa, wounded and then falling on his own sword. Saul&#8217;s story is one of unfulfilled possibilities. He had every reason to go down in history as Israel&#8217;s first and greatest king. Instead, he dies without God and without hope. He arrives here because of his own decisions. His epitaph simply reads, &#8220;A disappointment.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: It all starts with our simply obeying the voice of the Lord in our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disappointment 1 Samuel 31: Saul&#8230;died&#8230;that day.
