It\u2019s a song of praise and worship. It\u2019s also a song of fear and judgment. \u201cGod is holy,\u201d they proclaim, \u201call nations will come and worship you, because they see your judgments are right.\u201d That song ushers in the final set of the Lord\u2019s judgments on the earth. Angels are given the task of delivering those judgments. They&#8217;re given gold bowls, filled to the brim with the wrath of God. Any view of God that ignores his blazing hatred of sin is an incomplete view. He\u2019s merciful and kind and loving and has overflowing grace. He wants nothing more than to save people and his goal is to save every human being. That\u2019s all proven at Calvary. Some though, refuse his offer of salvation, an offer that cost him everything. Now, as time draws to an end we find ourselves face to face with the wrath of God. How dare people spit on his mercy? How dare they treat the crucifixion with distain? Now, in this vision, we\u2019re given a preview of the wrath of God. John sees smoke from God\u2019s glory and power pouring out of the heavenly Temple. It\u2019s a fearful thing to be even this close to the wrath of God.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Any view of the Lord that fails to take into account his hatred of sin is an incomplete view.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s wrath Revelation 15: One of the Four Animals handed the Seven Angels seven gold bowls, brimming with the wrath of God.
