As Ezra reads, something powerful is happening in the lives of his listeners. In some church traditions time is set aside every service for the reading of and hearing of the Word. This isn\u2019t the same as listening to a sermon, even if it&#8217;s well preached and faithful to the meaning of the passage being considered. This is hearing the Word simply as the Word and letting God minister his grace through it. There is, I believe, a place for the reading and hearing of Scripture in every church. We might have to shorten the singing a bit (or just lengthen the service) to make more room for Scripture. Most of us church folks claim to be &#8220;people of the Word.&#8221; Perhaps we should practice what we preach and give the reading of and listening to God&#8217;s Word a more prominent place in our services.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Word of the Lord is powerful \u2013 life changing \u2013 and we need to spend a significant amount of time letting it be drawn deeply into our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please stand for the reading of God\u2019s Word Nehemiah 8: He read it\u2026from early dawn until noon\u2026and all the people listened.
