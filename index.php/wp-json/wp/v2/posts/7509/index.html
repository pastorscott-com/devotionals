In his vision Ezekiel crawls all over the Temple measuring every nook and cranny, carefully taking note of every inch.  If I thought about it at all I thought maybe these were the plans for the promised rebuilding of the Temple.  However, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the actual intent.  The Lord tells Ezekiel, &#8220;Draw a picture so they can see the design and meaning and live by its design and intent.&#8221;  Concerning the Temple the prophet is told, &#8220;Everything around it becomes holy ground.&#8221;  God had called the people of Israel to be his own, holy nation.  All the laws, rituals, and even the construction of the Temple had the purpose of helping to bring that to pass.  In this case Ezekiel is to rediscover the power of the architecture of that place of worship.  Ezekiel&#8217;s vision of the Temple is to remind his people of how far they&#8217;ve fallen from the holiness to which they were called.  It&#8217;s also intended to give them hope and call them back to God.  Ezekiel&#8217;s going to go right on with his vision, talking about the rituals and the work of the priests and the feasts, all with that same intent.  However, I&#8217;m still thinking about the purpose of sacred space.  The Temple wasn\u2019t just built to be a functional place of worship.  It was to call people to holiness &#8212; a place set apart for the worship of a God set apart by a people set apart.  The layout and the furnishings weren\u2019t just for practical use.  Just looking at the building was to create longing for holiness.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m deep enough to fully grasp this, but I&#8217;m reminded today that as I read of Ezekiel with his tape measure that there&#8217;s more going on than just the drawing of blueprints.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for those gifted in the design of buildings set apart for the purpose of worship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sacred Space Ezekiel 43: Draw a picture&#8230; As a casual reader, one of the bewildering portions of Ezekiel has been, to me, all the measuring that takes place in the final chapters of the book.
