We\u2019re reminded of the Exodus from Egypt and Moses going up on the mountain for an encounter with the Almighty.  A result of that meeting is the Law.  They now have Ten Commandments to live by and soon there&#8217;s an entire body of Law to go with them.  In the passage before me today the Lord tells their descendants his purpose in all of that.  He did it as a part of his project to make them holy.  From the beginning and down through the centuries the Lord has continued to work to that end.  As he speaks through Ezekiel we find that God&#8217;s purpose has not been watered down or diverted.  In this passage, the Lord tells them that the whole &#8220;Sabbath day&#8221; approach was for this purpose, part of his grand plan.  This message is addressed to another generation that insists on resisting the Lord and the result is his rejecting them, erasing many lines that have been drawn, and nearly erasing them from the face of the earth.  What&#8217;s next?  The answer is obvious: it&#8217;s God&#8217;s purpose.  Their failure doesn&#8217;t change his purpose for them.  In new ways and with a new generation the Lord will return to the &#8220;business of making them holy.&#8221;  As he said to their ancestors, &#8220;Be holy because I am holy.&#8221;  I&#8217;m reminded today of just how committed God is to this business of holiness.  As one of his people, I want to cooperate with his purposes for me and for the entire human race.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is in the business of making people holy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s agenda isn\u2019t a secret Ezekiel 20: I, God, am in the business of making them holy.
