I&#8217;ll forget that they ever sinned.<br \/>\nA few years ago I developed an itching rash on the lower right side of my back.  I had some other stuff going on so when I went to the doctor I asked him about it.  He took one look at it and said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got shingles.&#8221;  I thought, &#8220;Shingles?  Old people get that!&#8221;  Honestly, at the time, I didn&#8217;t worry too much about it.  I could handle the itching.  However, I had no idea of the journey I was about to take.  The itching gave way to sleepless nights of burning pain.  For days I was homebound, unable to get dressed.  Now, at the beginning, I knew something was wrong but I thought it was going to be a minor inconvenience.  Only in the mid-term of the illness did I grasp just how bad things were.  I&#8217;ve seriously wondered if Job was given a full body version of shingles.  When the Lord tells me I&#8217;m a sinner my reaction is something like what I had at the doctor&#8217;s office.  It&#8217;s too bad; I&#8217;ll have to try harder to clean up my act.  What I don&#8217;t realize is that I&#8217;ve just been given a death sentence.  This isn&#8217;t just bad news; it&#8217;s the worst news possible.  It\u2019s only in this light that statements like the one I&#8217;m reading from Jeremiah carry the force they\u2019re supposed to.  Otherwise, we have God just helping us along in doing what we can pretty much handle for ourselves.   When I realize that being a sinner is to be broken beyond repair; to be, for all intents and purposes dead already; and when I realize that God, in his mercy is willing to &#8220;wipe the slate clean&#8221; and to &#8220;forget&#8221; it all&#8230;well, it\u2019s then that I begin to grasp the meaning of grace.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for his grace \u2013 without it, there\u2019s no hope whatsoever.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Death sentence reprieve Jeremiah 31: I&#8217;ll wipe the slate clean for each of them.
