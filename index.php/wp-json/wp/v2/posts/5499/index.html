Isaiah is describing God&#8217;s love for the people he created, picturing it as being like the love a groom has for his bride.  Things haven\u2019t gone well for Israel up to this point.  Their sin separated them from God and brought destruction to their land.  As a people they\u2019ve earned the nickname &#8220;Rejected&#8221; and their land can be rightly called &#8220;Ruined.&#8221;  Because of God&#8217;s love and forgiveness everything\u2019s going to change.  The &#8220;Rejected&#8221; people will be restored and the &#8220;Ruined&#8221; land will be brought back under the protection of the Lord.  The new name for God&#8217;s people will be &#8220;Hephzibah&#8221; or &#8220;My Delight&#8221; and the land will be called &#8220;Beulah&#8221; or &#8220;Married&#8221; meaning that the land will reflect its unique connection to the Lord.  Squire Parsons took the idea of a land uniquely the Lord&#8217;s to refer to heaven and his song is that of God&#8217;s people who long to go to that place that\u2019s God&#8217;s very own.<br \/>\nTake Away: The love and forgiveness of the Lord for us changes everything about us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Beulah Land Isaiah 62: You&#8217;ll be called Hephzibah and your land Beulah.
