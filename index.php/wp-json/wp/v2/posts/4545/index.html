In fact, the first words of the next chapter tell us that Saul has now reigned for many years. Apparently, he\u2019s doing a good job. For decades there have been no stories of failure. Life continues, securely and peacefully. Also, we see that Samuel is doing what he said he would do and is faithfully praying for them and providing spiritual guidance. Saul handles the day to day running of the country and Samuel&#8217;s the spiritual leader. Then historic things begin to happen. Saul&#8217;s son, Jonathan, attacks the Philistines at Gibeah and there\u2019s war. Outnumbered, Saul&#8217;s army flees and things are unraveling for Israel. The call goes out to Samuel to come and offer a sacrifice. God&#8217;s help is needed here! As Saul waits on Samuel his men are deserting, slipping away one after another. Finally, Saul decides he can wait no longer. Crossing the line that has existed between his authority and Samuel\u2019s he offers his own sacrifice. Of course, it\u2019s all a test. Will Saul follow God&#8217;s plan for how Israel is to function or will he abandon God&#8217;s approach when it seems necessary? His failure&#8217;s obvious. I can be pretty hard on Saul if I want to. God has been with him, always on his side, now he&#8217;s messed up (royally!). The trouble is that I have to admit that I can identify with Saul here. How good am I at waiting for God to move when I\u2019m under pressure? Do I tend to take matters into my own hands? This is a spectacular failure for Saul. Is it anything less when I fail in the same way?<br \/>\nTake Away: Waiting for God to move may be our greatest test of faith.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hurry up, Lord! 1 Samuel 13: So I took things into my own hands.
