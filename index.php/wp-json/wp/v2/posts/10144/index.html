He doesn\u2019t advise them to grit their teeth and hold on. Rather, he describes the victory that\u2019s already theirs. He envisions their gatherings as joyful, celebrative events in which they sing and laugh, buoyed by the living presence of Jesus in their lives. The idea here isn\u2019t that they pretend everything\u2019s okay when it obviously isn\u2019t. Instead, it\u2019s that they see a bigger picture and weighing their current situation against \u201ctotal salvation\u201d they find that they\u2019re the big winners. Beyond that, it\u2019s more than just \u201cpie in the sky\u201d for them. Something has happened and is happening in their lives right now. These are people who just can\u2019t get over how blessed they are. While it\u2019s true that my life is quite easy, especially in comparison to that of these scattered Christians, I do share in their blessings. As I get together with my Christian friends, whether it\u2019s in formal worship or relaxed fellowship, I hear lots of good singing and good natured laughter. That, my friend, is exactly as it should be.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s good to remember that it\u2019s a joy living in Jesus and that it\u2019s fun being with his people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy in Jesus 1Peter 1: You trust him, with laughter and singing.
