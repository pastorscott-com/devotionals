My first response is that &#8220;calm&#8221; is a relative term.  At almost any time I can find something unsettling to think about.  Just watching the evening news provides me plenty of \u201ctroublesome\u201d thought ammunition.  Frankly, of course, I don&#8217;t have to reach that far.  Like everyone else I always have something going on: family concerns, finances, and health spring to mind.  Again, calm is a relative term because much of this is just part of living.  No one has confused my neighborhood with the Garden of Eden and the same can be said of yours.  So, I must learn to take life in stride.  I&#8217;m not saying that life is always easy.  For everyone there are times of &#8220;flooding Jordan&#8221; that knock the props out of everything in our lives.  Even in that, though, the Lord isn&#8217;t giving me the permission to fall apart.  Through Jeremiah he tells me to stop making big deals out of little deals in my life; to learn to trust him in those common problems and then, when the &#8220;biggie&#8221; comes, to apply what I&#8217;ve learned about trust even as the flood waters really are sweeping through my life.  I know, I know, it&#8217;s easier said than done.  Then again, that&#8217;s why I have to practice keeping my wits about me in the little stuff first.<br \/>\nTake Away: As we learn to trust the Lord with the little things of life we lay the foundation for trusting him with the big ones when they come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t sweat the little stuff Jeremiah 12: What&#8217;s going to happen when troubles break loose?
