As far as they\u2019re concerned they\u2019ve heard it all before.  If Isaiah wants their attention he has to come up with a new approach, something unique and interesting.  Otherwise, in their opinion, they\u2019re too sophisticated for his old message.  The prophet says, &#8220;You aren&#8217;t as advanced as you think you are.  In fact, God\u2019s going to strip everything back to the bare basics and his message to you is going to be &#8216;baby talk.'&#8221;  Isaiah describes the Lord&#8217;s new approach in dealing with these know-it-all people as laying a new cornerstone.  That stone, he says, will be inscribed with God&#8217;s communication to his people: &#8220;A trusting life won&#8217;t topple.&#8221;  That message is, at the same time, both simple and profound.  It\u2019s simple because anyone can understand it.  It\u2019s profound because it\u2019s the secret to maintaining life in the Lord.  God isn&#8217;t looking for clever people who come up with all kinds of gimmicks and cute slogans.  Instead, he\u2019s looking for people who\u2019ll simply trust him.  As I read of the Lord\u2019s future plans for the people of Isaiah&#8217;s day, I see that he wants me, as one of his people, to hold steady, always trusting in him.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord\u2019s looking for people who\u2019ll simply trust him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Baby talk Isaiah 28: This is the meaning of the stone: A TRUSTING LIFE WON&#8217;T TOPPLE.
