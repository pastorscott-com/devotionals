However, many years earlier Jeremiah was locked up and continued to declare his messages from God.  In this case Jeremiah is in jail for insisting that the invading Babylonian army is going to be successful.  He urges everyone to surrender and take their punishment.  Even as he&#8217;s proclaiming this message, the Lord tells him that he needs to conduct some family business.  It must have seemed odd to his fellow prisoners to see this man who\u2019s been saying their nation is about to fall stop to buy some land from a relative of his.  If everyone\u2019s going to be taken away as Jeremiah claims, why in the world would he take time to buy property?  Jeremiah does his business and then asks that the deed and other paperwork be sealed in a jar and buried.  That deed won&#8217;t be of any use for a long time but someday it\u2019ll be dug up and still be good when God&#8217;s people return to their homeland many years hence.  Even as Jeremiah proclaims coming disaster he does so with hope for a brighter future.  Today, my message may, at times, be more negative than positive.  My nation can&#8217;t expect to continue down the God-ignoring road it\u2019s on and think that God won&#8217;t notice.  Still, though, my message should, in general, be a positive one.  What happened at Calvary brings the hope of salvation to the whole human race.  Even when there&#8217;s plenty to be concerned about, that&#8217;s the really big news.<br \/>\nTake Away: What happened at Calvary brings the hope of salvation to the whole human race.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Business, but not quite \u201cas usual\u201d Jeremiah 32: I will restore everything that was lost.
