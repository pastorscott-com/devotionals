I struggle with the result of David&#8217;s sin being the death of this innocent child. I wish I had some nifty, easy-to-swallow answer that fits neatly into my understanding of God, but I don&#8217;t. I can just barely reach out and grasp the concept that God is the Giver of Life and that he can take that gift by his own sovereignty. That doesn&#8217;t really solve my problem with this passage although it causes me to acknowledge that God is God and that this is all under his authority. David prays and fasts that his son might be spared, asking God to show him mercy. He knows that God is merciful, so there\u2019s hope that it might just happen. But it doesn&#8217;t and the child dies. If you think I\u2019m about to come up with some devotional gem here, well, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint, but I have nothing. That doesn&#8217;t stop me from believing that &#8220;God is love&#8221; and that he\u2019s a compassionate and merciful God. All I can do is confess my failure to understand and go on trusting in the good character of the Lord. Frankly, this isn&#8217;t as isolated a situation as I would like it to be. Still, I go on trusting in those situations too.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even when we don\u2019t understand we can trust. Actually, that\u2019s a definition of faith.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes I just don\u2019t get it 2 Samuel 12: The son born to you will die.
