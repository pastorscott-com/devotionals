Some women, apparently due to a language barrier, aren\u2019t getting a fair share of the food the church is providing.  The disciples realize that this is an important concern and willingly share the leadership responsibilities with seven non-apostles.  The result is that the disciples are able to focus on their role in the church while sharing some responsibilities with those who have gifts for that purpose.  The needs of the people are met and the church continues to advance.  As a pastor I\u2019ve read this account again and again trying to understand it in light of the current pastor\/congregation scheme that\u2019s generally in place.   I\u2019ve tried to translate it into the 21st century average Protestant church with an average attendance of 70 to 100.  On one hand, I realize that the church of Acts now numbers in the thousands.  Even if the disciples try to handle it all it simply can\u2019t be.  The question that comes to mind is, is that the only reason for the addition of non-clergy leadership?  I think that a lot of church people think so.  In their smaller situations they\u2019re very pastor-centric.  They want the pastor to be the one who visits them when they\u2019re sick and who makes regular nursing home visits.  They expect the pastor to attend every committee meeting and to pray every public prayer.  Then, if the church grows, they\u2019ll take care of things by hiring an assistant pastor.  I can\u2019t help but think this is mistaken because I have the idea that the division of leadership in the Acts church isn\u2019t all about size and work load.  Rather, I believe the leadership and ministry opportunities need to be shared because it\u2019s healthier for the church.  Had the disciples been perfectly capable of caring for the widows while handling the preaching and teaching responsibilities, I still think they would have done, under the Spirit\u2019s leadership, just what they did.  Some church people need to find a place of ministry and plug in, not always looking to the pastor to do it all.  Some pastors need to quit hogging all the ministry opportunities and give others a chance.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Lord didn\u2019t come to be served, but to serve and we aren\u2019t his followers unless we follow him into lives of service of others.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pastors and their congregations Acts 6: Choose seven men from among you whom everyone trusts.
