Some of them are pretty hard to read as they deal with stuff like fluid emissions, forced marriage, and rape.  Others strike me as mostly curious.  The prohibition against plowing with an ox and a donkey yoked together and the one against wearing clothes of mixed fabrics comes to mind.  Then there are the practical ones like what to do if a farmer finds his neighbor\u2019s ox loose and wandering around, rules for charging interest on loans, and the prohibition on carrying differing weights.  This is a simple call to honesty.  An individual doing business isn\u2019t to have two weights that he claims are the same but are actually different.  A dishonest person might reach into bag and grab the heavier weight when purchasing, say, some silver.  Then, when selling it, he might use an identical, lighter weight to measure the weight of the silver.  That way he gets more silver than he paid for, and then cheats the buyer by selling less than what is shown on the scales.  The Lord says, \u201cdon\u2019t do that \u2013 instead, be honest in your dealings with everyone.\u201d  Some of the stuff in these chapters feels dated and even a bit weird.  However, a call to honesty in business speaks to every person who\u2019s ever filled out a tax return or sold a used car.   In all of business God\u2019s people are free to make the best deal they can; that is, so long as it\u2019s an honest deal.<br \/>\nTake Away: Honesty is the best (and blessed) policy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let\u2019s make a deal Deuteronomy 25: Don\u2019t carry around with you two weights.
