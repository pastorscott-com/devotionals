However, Job is a clear thinker.  He understands that the only way a man can be right with God is by God&#8217;s mercy.  He trusts in God, but he understands that it\u2019s only by grace and mercy that he has a standing before the Lord.  The impressive thing about Job, however, isn\u2019t that he has a firm grasp on spiritual truths that won&#8217;t be fully revealed until Jesus explains them.  The impressive thing is that even when he feels he\u2019s being treated unjustly by God, even when he doesn&#8217;t understand what\u2019s going on, and even as he cries out for a fair hearing on this whole matter, he stands firm in his faith.  In all this, we\u2019re reminded that faith trumps even knowledge.  That&#8217;s not only vital for Job, but it\u2019s vital for me too.<br \/>\nTake Away: Faith trumps even knowledge.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The most important thing Job 9: I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on.
