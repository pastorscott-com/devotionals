He declares that marriage is to be between a man and a woman and that their union is to be both physical and spiritual.  No one has the authority to rip apart that union.  Jesus, speaking in the manner of a rabbi and with the authority of the Son of God, adds that in the case of adultery he allows (but, note, he doesn\u2019t \u201crequire\u201d) an exception to this permanent man\/woman union.  The leaders, then, want to know why Moses includes a broader divorce procedure in the Law.  Is Jesus claiming authority beyond that of Moses?  His answer is eye-opening.  Moses, Jesus says, finds it necessary to provide for the destruction of a marriage because of people\u2019s hard hearts.  God didn\u2019t plan for this to be necessary, but Moses sees the need and God allows it.  This interpretation is fascinating.  On one level, I\u2019m interested in this situation in which God doesn\u2019t get his way and in which he allows Moses to adjust things.  If God has his own way there will never be a divorce.  However, since people have hard hearts the Lord allows the Law to accommodate it.  This is an interesting application of the Lord\u2019s commitment to our free-will.  The other thing that gets my attention is the strong possibility that I can, because of my hardheartedness insist on something that the Lord reluctantly allows, leaving me in a permanent sub-par situation.  I\u2019m glad we serve a God of Second Chances and I know that in him, life is good.  Still, I see that the Lord won\u2019t stop me from doing that which will bring a lifetime of pain, or at the very best, a lifetime of knowing that if not for my stubbornness things could be better for me than what they are.  I\u2019m thankful for the grace of God, but I\u2019m also aware that I have a real responsibility to live carefully and to remain in harmony with the Lord each step of the way.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Even though the Lord will allow it, I must be careful to not overrule God\u2019s will in my life.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living with our decisions Matthew 19: Moses provided for divorce as a concession to your hardheartedness, but it is not part of God\u2019s original plan.
