Isaiah says he&#8217;s going to make a list of the things &#8220;God has done that need praising&#8221; and then work his way through that list.  Like many Christians I have a prayer list that\u2019s filled with concerns and needs.  I think it&#8217;s a good idea; after all, there are many genuine needs and the Lord welcomes us to share our heart&#8217;s concerns.  However, I need to balance that out by having, in addition to a prayer list, a &#8220;praise list&#8221; as well.  Otherwise, I\u2019m in danger of behaving like the nine lepers who are healed by Jesus.  They rush on into their new lives without a backward glance while only one returns to say &#8220;thanks&#8221; to our Lord.  I need to purposely make the effort to spend time each day rejoicing in all the Lord has done for me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our \u201cneed filled\u201d prayers should be balanced by strong component of \u201cpraise filled\u201d prayers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praise list Isaiah 63: I&#8217;ll make a list of God&#8217;s gracious dealings.
