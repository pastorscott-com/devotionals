I actually think there\u2019s some truth to that.  Life is a gift of God filled with many wonderful opportunities and blessings.  I can&#8217;t sit around talking about &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; and get the most out of my life.  There&#8217;s a lot of living to do right now.  The wise man of the Proverbs, though, gives me the other side of that coin.  If I make my life completely about living in the here and now, ignoring all that is yet to come, well, I&#8217;m setting myself up for a great fall.  Life is more than &#8220;right now.&#8221;  This life might be considered to be a warm up for eternity.  So, grabbing the gusto can make sense, but that approach must be kept on a leash and not allowed to just run wild because there\u2019s much more to our existence than just going &#8217;round once.  Or, as Jesus says in Matthew 6:20, &#8220;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: One way to live the best life possible in the here and now is to live with an eye on eternity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grabbing the gusto, looking to eternity Proverbs 1: When you grab all you can get, that&#8217;s when it happens: the more you get, the less you have.
