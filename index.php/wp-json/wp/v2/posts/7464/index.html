We Christians are sometimes guilty of making the Lord out to be angry and vengeful.  Here I am, reading a book of the Bible that&#8217;s full of words of condemnation and judgment and finding as compassionate a word as I could ever find.  God hates sin but he loves the sinner.  For the Lord to blink at sin &#8212; to call it something less than what it is &#8212; would be for him to deny his own nature.  Rather than do that, he does everything he can to call us from our sin and to remake us into a clean people.  If God&#8217;s remedy for sin was to wipe out the sinners, well, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this and you wouldn&#8217;t be reading it.  Ezekiel&#8217;s ministry is to call sinners to repentance.  Today, through Jesus Christ, that same call is heard.  The thing that brings pleasure to God is not punishing sinners.  Instead, it&#8217;s rescuing us from death to life.  With God on our side like that, we have every reason to trust him and surrender to him.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord hates sin but he loves the sinner.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What pleases God?
