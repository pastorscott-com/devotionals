I come unannounced, like a thief. You\u2019re blessed if, awake and dressed, you\u2019re ready for me.<\/p>\n<p>The seven bowls of God\u2019s wrath bring untold misery to the earth. Some of the miseries remind us of what happened in the limited region of Egypt during the ten plagues. In this case, though, the suffering is worldwide. When God\u2019s attention specifically turns to the Beast and his unholy trinity they rally the nations of the earth to fight back. Armageddon is at hand. There\u2019s so much here that I don\u2019t understand that I\u2019m ashamed of myself. Here I am in the book called \u201cRevelation\u201d and I\u2019m constantly reminded that I\u2019m missing whatever it is I\u2019m supposed to grasp. Still, once in a while I\u2019m graciously given something to which I can cling. Even if I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m advised to \u201cKeep watch!\u201d and to be \u201cready.\u201d Jesus said the same thing during his earthly ministry and now he repeats it. Even as I muddle through these pictures of judgment filled with symbolism that I\u2019m missing more than understanding, I\u2019m encouraged to simply hang in there. I may not understand Armageddon but I understand what it means to stand fast in my relationship with the Lord. Ultimately, it\u2019s that that matters much more than my poor grasp on the precise meaning of passages like this.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Even when you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on stand fast in the faith. Ultimately, that\u2019s what matters the most anyway.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Muddling my way through, holding fast Revelation 16: Keep watch!
