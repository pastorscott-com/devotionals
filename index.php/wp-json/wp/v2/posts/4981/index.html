If I\u2019m ever tempted to divide &#8220;sacred&#8221; from &#8220;secular&#8221; in my life I need to spend some time thinking about Ezra and Nehemiah. Nehemiah&#8217;s work is every bit as necessary and Spirit-driven as is that of Ezra. When Nehemiah hears of the conditions in distant Jerusalem he immediately prepares to do something about it; not by organizing work crews and accumulating building materials, but by praying. As God&#8217;s people, everything we do, even building walls, is done &#8220;unto the Lord&#8221; and therefore, falls under the &#8220;sacred&#8221; category.<br \/>\nTake Away: Everything we do as a people of the Lord has a sacred flavor to it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two sides of the same coin Nehemiah 1: The wall of Jerusalem is still rubble; the city gates are still cinders.
