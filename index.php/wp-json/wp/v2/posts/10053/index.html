He\u2019s pioneered the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the region. He\u2019s been at the forefront of a tidal wave of the work of the Holy Spirit and, because of that, he\u2019s not only taken plenty of hits, he\u2019s also seen first-hand just what God can do. Paul, though, is quite humble about all that. He doesn\u2019t glorify himself. Rather, he gives glory to the Lord for it all. At times, even though he\u2019s in the middle of it all he\u2019s found himself more bystander than participant as something \u201cwondrously powerful\u201d happens. Paul understands that it isn\u2019t his cleverness or winning personality that\u2019s \u201ctriggered a believing response.\u201d The message about Christ is actually delivered by Christ, through Paul. I wish I had a better handle on this. So often I find myself behaving as though it\u2019s all about my performance. I let myself become so focused on how I\u2019m doing that I forget that, actually, I\u2019m not required to do much at all. The Lord wants me to place my full weight of trust on him and allow him to minister through me. My cooperation is required and the Lord will use my personality, education, etc. along the way, but it\u2019s all powered by his Holy Spirit and not by me. There are times when Paul is amazed at the response to his ministry. As I cooperate with the Lord, I, too, will be surprised as lives are touched as the Lord ministers to people through me. Let\u2019s not be guilty of underestimating the ability of the Lord to minister through us.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: As we cooperate with the Lord he does amazing things through us that surprise us as much as anyone else.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Holy Spirit working through me Romans 15: The wondrously powerful and transformingly present words and deeds of Christ in me.
