Before they ever arrive in Canaan the Lord will already be at work there, preparing the way for them.  The inhabitants of that land will be visited by \u201cTerror\u201d and \u201cDespair.\u201d  Just the thought of the coming Israelites will cause them to withdraw, yielding the land to them without a fight.  However, the Lord also tells them that the withdrawal of these heathen people won\u2019t happen all at once.  If all human beings desert the land then the weeds and wild animals will take over and Canaan land won\u2019t be as wonderful as the Lord wants it to be for his people.  While I know it didn\u2019t work out, I can\u2019t help but imagine a very different picture from both the books of Joshua and Judges.  As I consider this passage I find myself thinking of God\u2019s work in my life.  As one of God\u2019s people I have some precious promises.  He\u2019s with me and he\u2019ll make a way even when there is no way.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean all the battles are already won.  Like the people of Israel, I\u2019m to trust in the Lord and to move forward, believing that, by his grace, I can face whatever obstacles might arise.  It would be nice if all the signal lights in my life were permanently on green even as I sit in the driveway, but it doesn\u2019t work that way.  I have to move out in trust and allow the Lord to help me through the rough areas one step at a time.<br \/>\nTake Away: God\u2019s work in my life is that of unfolding grace, him making the way for me, one day at a time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God will go before you Exodus 23: I won\u2019t get rid of them all at once lest the land grow up in weeds and the wild animals take over.
