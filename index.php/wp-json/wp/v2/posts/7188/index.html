When the wind is strong enough to blow down a tree, well, down it comes.  In other words, things happen when they\u2019re ready to happen.  Sitting around waiting on them is a waste of time; time that could be spent doing something worthwhile.  We spend a lot of time dreaming about things happening that will only happen when the time is right.  Meanwhile, there\u2019s living to do.  The farmer might hope for rain, but he isn&#8217;t to sit out in the field watching the sky, instead he gets on with the work he can do right now.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with looking forward to some future blessing and even taking a quick look to the horizon to see if it\u2019s in sight yet.  However, our lives aren&#8217;t to come to a stop while we wait.  The issue isn\u2019t &#8220;what\u2019s God going to do?&#8221;  Rather it\u2019s, &#8220;what\u2019s God doing right now and how can I work with him in doing it?&#8221;  Staring at the clouds is a waste of time; we need to &#8220;get on with&#8230;life.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t live your life waiting for something to happen \u2013 instead, connect with what&#8217;s happening right now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Watching the wind Ecclesiastes 11: Don&#8217;t sit there watching the wind, Do your own work.
