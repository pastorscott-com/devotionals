No hidden, mystic religion of riddles here. Jesus\u2019 purpose is to open wide the doors to the Kingdom of God. People who never understood before now get a crystal clear picture of God at work. Now we understand how the gospel takes root in some lives but not in others. We see what happens when the gospel does take root, starting small but becoming a huge, transforming force in life. And, we see God\u2019s purpose in all this. Those who receive the gospel are to let the light of that gospel shine in their lives. We aren\u2019t to be \u201ckeepers of the flame.\u201d Instead, we\u2019re \u201cgivers of the flame.\u201d We don\u2019t take the gospel into our lives and hide it. Instead, it\u2019s to be the noticeable thing about us. So, how\u2019s it going? Do people see the light of the gospel in my life? If I\u2019m one of those who has received the gospel and if it has taken root and become the number one thing in my life, is it what others see in me? At the very core of my life, I\u2019m to be a \u201csecret teller\u201d letting others in on the best news in the world. If not, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not the kind of \u201csoil\u201d I think I am!<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Some secrets are best told.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve got a secret Mark 4: We\u2019re not keeping secrets, we\u2019re telling them.
