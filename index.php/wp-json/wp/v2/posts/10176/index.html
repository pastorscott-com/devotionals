In John\u2019s day, seeing Rome as the seat of evil in the world makes a lot of sense. Some continue to take the woman, Babylon, and description of the riddle to add up to the literal Rome, carrying with it lots of religious overtones. Frankly, it\u2019s beyond me (seems I\u2019ve been saying that a lot lately). If it isn\u2019t to be taken literally, it may be that the \u201cBabylon\u201d represents a current world power that dominants the world as Rome did in John\u2019s day. All of this is the set up for the big battle. This world power will rally the nations of the world to battle against the Lamb of God. Then, before the battle is even described, we\u2019re told the outcome of it. The Lamb wins. In the end, there will be no doubt as to his high standing: Lord over all lords, King over all kings. The descriptions of judgment, war, and destruction are soon to give way to victory, worship, and the exaltation of the Lamb of God.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We don\u2019t have to understand everything to understand this: in the end, the Lamb reigns.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The end is at hand, the end is at hand!
