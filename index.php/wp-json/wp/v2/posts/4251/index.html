It was fire that Moses encountered in the desert; it\u2019s a pillar of fire that leads them at night.  The fire of the Altar also symbolizes the presence and work of Jehovah in their midst.  Because of that, the command is that it never be allowed to go out.  The application is pretty easy to understand and not so easy to apply.  I want the fire of God\u2019s presence in my life to burn freely \u2013 and, like that of the burning bush: never go out.  It was the work of those who tended to the Tent of Meeting to assure the perpetuity of the flame, and it\u2019s my responsibility to keep that flame burning in my life.
