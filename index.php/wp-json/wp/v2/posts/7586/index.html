Their story would have ended in Egypt centuries earlier had it not been for him.  Countless nations have come and gone, yet they remain.  And it isn&#8217;t as though the Lord has done all this in secret.  Instead, he&#8217;s been very active, openly blessing them and speaking to them through prophets and priests and kings.  Hosea&#8217;s people have every reason to know God and to worship him alone.  Through Hosea the Lord says, &#8220;I write out my revelation for them in detail and they pretend they can&#8217;t read it.&#8221;  Like a child who puts his hands over his ears and sings &#8220;La, la, la &#8212; I can&#8217;t hear you&#8221; these rebellious people have quite intentionally turned from God, ignoring his call to them.  However, it isn&#8217;t going to work.  It is one thing to be unintentionally ignorant; mixed up and confused.  It&#8217;s another to know that the message is there but to refuse to hear it.  I think there are many people in my country today who are honestly confused and that, to a great extent we Christians are responsible because we&#8217;ve failed to clearly reflect Christ to them.  However, we aren&#8217;t so far from the reach of God that everyone&#8217;s in that situation.  Many are covering their ears so they can&#8217;t hear what he&#8217;s saying.  That, my friend, isn\u2019t a smart thing to do.<br \/>\nTake Away: There may be a lot that we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s vitally important that we listen to, and obey, what we do know.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ignoring God Hosea 8: I write out my revelation for them in detail and they pretend they can&#8217;t read it.
