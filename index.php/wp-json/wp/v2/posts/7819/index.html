Aside from his name the author is unknown to us.  In fact, we may not even know his name!  \u201cMalachi\u201d may be a title rather than a name.  The word means \u201cMy Messenger\u201d therefore the writer may be only identifying himself as a messenger of God.  Another challenge is the date of the book.  Malachi is unique because it isn\u2019t associated with some coming disaster or some regional event that has everyone\u2019s attention.  Instead, this book highlights the danger that threatens when life is just rolling along at a normal pace.  The scholars guess Malachi dates a little over 400 years before Christ because it appears the Temple has been rebuilt and the sacrificial system is in full operation.  Since most of life is lived somewhere between wonderful, extravagant days and horrible, painful ones, Malachi is a practical book for most of us most of the time.  Whoever Malachi is, he marches into their crisis-free lives and boldly proclaims that they\u2019ve been lulled to sleep by the lack of perceived danger and because of that, are in a crisis and don\u2019t even realize it.  This little book has something to say to every day Christians just like me.<br \/>\nTake Away: The danger in common days is that we\u2019ll be lulled to sleep and neglect that which really matters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The practical book of the Old Testament Malachi 1: God\u2019s Word to Israel through Malachi.
