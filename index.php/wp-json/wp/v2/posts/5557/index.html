God has a talk with Jeremiah about his ministry.  It\u2019s here that Jeremiah is given a frightening command.  God says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t pray for these people&#8230;I&#8217;m not going to listen.&#8221;  I find that command as chilling as icy wind on a bleak winter day.  Grace has been withdrawn and hope is dead.  God says to them, &#8220;I have pronounced doom on you.&#8221;  Once that bridge has been crossed it&#8217;s too late to pray.  The Lord explains to Jeremiah that there are things happening beyond his view.  Jeremiah says, &#8220;I had no idea what was going on&#8221; even concerning schemes against him, personally.  In this case the withdrawal of grace is for a specific people and time.  Later on Jesus makes it clear that God&#8217;s grace is available to &#8220;whoever believes.&#8221;  On one hand, my realization of this brings me a sense of relief and I&#8217;m glad that I don&#8217;t live in a &#8220;don&#8217;t pray for these people&#8221; time in history.  On the other hand, I&#8217;m reminded that there are clouds on the horizon.  Personally, we each are promised a day when we\u2019ll breathe our last and our future will be sealed.  Beyond that, at a time &#8220;we do not know&#8221; the curtain of God&#8217;s grace is going to fall on history.  What I do with the offer of grace now will make an eternal difference then.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s foolish to treat our relationship with the Lord with anything short of a sense of urgency.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Commanded by God not to pray Jeremiah 11: I don&#8217;t want you praying for this people.
