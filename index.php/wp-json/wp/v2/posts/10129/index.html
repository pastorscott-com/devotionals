Once they possess Canaan they\u2019ll be home at last. However it doesn\u2019t work out. The people refuse to trust God and, because of that, are sentenced to a lifetime of wilderness wandering. The writer of Hebrews uses that sad story to tell his readers that the Lord calls his people to a \u201crest experience\u201d in their relationship with him. After deliverance from sin, there\u2019s a \u201cJordan River\u201d crisis in which believers are to trust God to give them rest from the inner struggle and freedom to love him with all their heart and soul and mind. The failure of the people of Israel is a real possibility for the believer: to doubt the extent to which the Lord can deliver his people from the bondage of sin. To fail here is to turn back to the wilderness and to experience the spiritual journey as a constant struggle with failure and sin. To believe God and trust him with all of one\u2019s life is to cross the Jordan and enter into a deeper spiritual life of freedom and liberty. \u201cThe promise of \u2018arrival\u2019 and \u2018rest\u2019 are still there for God\u2019s people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Lord not only forgives our sins \u2013 he also delivers us from that sin.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The \u201crest\u201d for the people of God Hebrews 4: The promise of \u201carrival\u201d and \u201crest\u201d are still there for God\u2019s people.
