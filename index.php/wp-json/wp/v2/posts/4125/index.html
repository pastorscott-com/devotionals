When the king is troubled by the dreams and wants someone to explain their meaning to him, Joseph, under the inspiration of the Lord, comes through.  His new job is to take advantage of the coming seven years of bounty in preparation for the following seven years of famine.  Joseph does such a good job of this that, once the famine hits, Egypt has enough grain for its own citizens and plenty to sell to surrounding nations too.  I know there\u2019s a huge difference of scale, but we\u2019re expected to do the same thing in our lives.  We may not have a vision or a dream or some other specific advance knowledge of what\u2019s coming but we do know this: every person goes through both good days and bad.  That\u2019s not only true of our financial picture, it\u2019s also true spiritually.  I need to take full advantage of times of spiritual refreshment.  Right now I may have extra time to spend in the presence of the Lord, to bask in the light of his love.  Later on, a crisis will come (note: I didn\u2019t say \u201cmight come\u201d) when there will be no time for quiet reflection on spiritual truths.  I need to fill the storehouse of my life with the good things the Lord is providing for me right now so that when I need them, they\u2019ll be there to help me through troubled times.<br \/>\nTake away: What am I \u201cstoring up\u201d now that will help me when it\u2019s time to make a withdrawal?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The coming crisis Genesis 41: Egypt was the only country that had bread.
