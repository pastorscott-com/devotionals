He also tells Moses that the current inhabitants are to be driven out.  No one currently living there is to remain.  One way or another, they have to go.  If the people of Israel fail in this mission the Canaanites will become thorns in their sides; the source of downfall and destruction.  I wonder if the spiritual failures I sometimes see in people\u2019s lives parallel this.  The Lord calls me to full surrender to himself.  I\u2019m to give him my past, present, and future placing it all in his hands.  My habits and wants, my plans and dreams must be handed over to the Lord.  As long as I hold things in reserve, I haven\u2019t yet purified the \u201cCanaan\u201d of my heart.  If I keep some things locked away in some dark corner of my life the day will come when they will become a \u201ccinder\u201d in my eye and a \u201csplinter\u201d in my foot.  The old hymn of invitation that&#8217;s actually a prayer beautifully speaks to this: \u201cAll to Jesus I surrender, I surrender all.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: I surrender my all and in return, the Lord fills me with himself \u2013 it\u2019s a very good deal for me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Purifying the land Numbers 33: Everyone you let stay there will become a cinder in your eye and a splinter in your foot.
