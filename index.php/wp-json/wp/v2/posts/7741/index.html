As I started reading Habakkuk and saw his reverent complaint to God I was reminded of the Psalms of complaint in which the writer pours his heart out before the Lord. Now, as Habakkuk experiences God in a fresh way, his words remind me of the Psalms again. He pens a psalm of his own in which he recounts God\u2019s past deliverance and looks to a day of restoration. His opening lines: \u201cDo among us what you did among them. Work among us as you worked among them\u201d is the prayer of many of God\u2019s people through the ages. In this case, Habakkuk is specifically thinking of the deliverance of his ancestors from Egyptian bondage. However, through the centuries, many have looked back to great movements of God: revivals, healings, and other times of special blessing and prayed this prayer. In my life there have been times of extraordinary blessing, some so private and precious that I seldom speak of them. However, I mention them to the Lord, thanking him for what he did and marveling at his grace to me and, in the spirit of Habakkuk, ask the Lord to \u201cdo it again.\u201d It\u2019s unhealthy to spend our lives talking about the \u201cgood old days\u201d but we should allow those times of special blessing to remind us of what God can do and to encourage us to seek his best for in our lives in this day and in these circumstances.<br \/>\nTake Away: There are times when we do well to revisit past blessings and allow those blessings to encourage us to expect renewed blessings of God in our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do it again, Lord Habakkuk 3: Do among us what you did among them.
