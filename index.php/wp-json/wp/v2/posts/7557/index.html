He&#8217;s to go about living life without fretting or worrying about how it will all play out.  The Lord&#8217;s final message to Daniel is &#8220;relax.&#8221;  I firmly believe that there are crucial events in world history when God puts specific people in a specific place for just that moment.  However, most of us are called to simply live for God day by day.  We don&#8217;t have to figure it all out and we don&#8217;t have to become famous Christians.  If I give my life to Jesus and by his grace live for him I can &#8220;relax.&#8221;  As Daniel&#8217;s promised, &#8220;When it&#8217;s all over, you will be on your feet to receive your reward.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Most of us are called to simply live for the Lord day by day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t worry about it Daniel 12: Go about your business without fretting or worrying.
