Hitting a 95 mph fastball requires one\u2019s full attention.  Jesus calls people to radical commitment.  Fishermen abandon the tools of their trade to follow him.  Tax collectors pay back, with interest, padded tax collections.  Rich people are told to give it all away and follow.  How can we read this kind of stuff in the Bible and come away thinking that all God wants from us is a lukewarm, half-hearted relationship?  If I\u2019m going to be a disciple of Jesus I have to focus and commit.  Living the Sermon on the Mount takes a lot more than an hour of church attendance each week.  How in the world could anyone ever think otherwise?  The payoff is wonderful, but the payout is huge: all of me for all of God.  I\u2019m the winner in that deal, but it\u2019s still a deal I have to be willing to make.  <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: When it comes to living the Christian life it\u2019s all or nothing.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One hundred percent Matthew 7: The way to life \u2013 to God! \u2013 is vigorous and requires total attention.
