He finishes his writing by looking to the future and reporting on the end of history.  When things appear hopeless the Almighty will come to the rescue in what will be the final battle.  The Lord will set foot on the historic Mount of Olives, just east of Jerusalem.  Years after this prophecy Jesus prays on the Mount of Olives at the Garden of Gethsemane, and later, following his resurrection he ascends to heaven from the Mount of Olives.  As he disappears into the sky angels deliver God\u2019s message that Jesus will return in \u201clike manner.\u201d  Like pieces of a puzzle revealed as the centuries pass, things fall into place.  Zechariah says that when the Lord comes he\u2019ll defeat the final enemy and when he sets foot on the Mount of Olives that it will split in half.  His coming will bring all things to an end.  At the same time it will begin all things anew.  Then, as the disciples stand on that very same spot, angels tell them Jesus is coming back even as he has just left them.  Oh yeah, Zechariah has it right: \u201cwhat a Day that will be!\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: God\u2019s people look forward to the glorious return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The end and the beginning Zechariah 14: What a Day that will be!
