How much did it cost you?<\/p>\n<p>The captain isn\u2019t having a good day.  He\u2019s arrested a man thinking he\u2019s caught an Egyptian troublemaker but now realizes he has the wrong man.  He then lets the man address the crowd, and to his surprise he addresses them in Hebrew.  In a few minutes, there\u2019s another riot and the man has to be rescued again.  At this point the captain has had enough; he\u2019ll beat the facts out of the fellow and be done with it.  Then, as soldiers prepare to do the flogging the man informs them that he\u2019s a Roman citizen.  To be guilty of detaining and torturing a Roman citizen could be disastrous to his career.  Additionally, the captain takes Roman citizenship quite seriously because obtaining his own citizenship had been an expensive process.  Now, he\u2019s come within a few minutes of jeopardizing his career because of this mysterious man.  He asks Paul how he obtained his Roman citizenship and Paul responds that he was born free.  Commentators aren\u2019t sure how it is that Paul&#8217;s a Roman citizen but the best idea is that his home town, Tarsus, has been declared \u201cfree\u201d by Caesar.  Such a town is bound to allegiance to Rome, but its citizens are unfettered by the heavy hand of Rome.  These people have the rights of a Roman citizen.  The captain&#8217;s impressed that Paul was born with a privilege that has cost him dearly.  For my part, I\u2019m somewhere between the captain and Paul.  I wasn\u2019t born free.  Rather, I was born a slave to sin and the price for my freedom was far beyond anything I could pay.  However, the price was paid, in fact, had already been paid 2000 years earlier.  My freedom was obtained at great cost.  How much did it cost me?  Nothing; but it cost Jesus everything.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I\u2019ve been set free a great price: the blood of Jesus.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Citizenship Acts 22: I paid a huge sum for my citizenship.
