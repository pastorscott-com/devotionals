Some of the descriptions may be merely historical. Some things, though, like the perfect cube of the Holy of Holies likely carries meaning beyond the description. In the case of the two huge bronze (or copper) pillars at the doorway of the Temple, we don\u2019t have to guess because we\u2019re given the symbolic meaning. The six foot thick, twenty-seven foot tall pillars represent \u201cJakin\u201d and \u201cBoaz\u201d \u2013 that is, Security and Stability. These are wonderful attributes whether we\u2019re talking about the life of an individual or that of a nation. Every time the people of Israel of that era enter the Temple they\u2019re reminded of the Source of their Security and Stability. We may not have a couple of large shining pillars at the entrance to our churches, but we certainly need to be reminded of the truth they symbolize. If I want to live a spiritually secure and stable life I must be firmly grounded in the Lord. The same benefit is available to a nation that allows the Lord to shape its character.<br \/>\nTake Away: We must build our lives on the Rock and not on the sand if we want to live secure, stabile lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jakin and Boaz 2 Chronicles 3: The right pillar he named Jakin (Security) and the left pillar he named Boaz (Stability).
