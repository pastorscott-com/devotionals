Go ahead.&#8221;<br \/>\nI\u2019ve heard some say that the fact that God gives permission for Job to be tested brings comfort to them. They tie it in to Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 10:13: &#8220;No test or temptation that comes your way is beyond the course of what others have had to face. All you need to remember is that God will never let you down; he\u2019ll never let you be pushed past your limit; he\u2019ll always be there to help you come through it.&#8221; I see what they see in this. In the midst of the pain and suffering there\u2019s some consolation in remembering that God is allowing this and he wouldn&#8217;t allow it if he didn&#8217;t know I can take it. However, this also troubles me. To think that the Lord grants permission for a life to be devastated (not to mention the very lives of Job&#8217;s children) is hard to take. I think this is why some people have decided that this is a parable-like story rather than a historical one. If this is fiction based on fact I can relax and focus on learning the lessons I can learn here. If, though, this is the real deal then I find myself struggling. If you think I am about to come up with some profound answer I fear you\u2019re going to be disappointed. Beyond that, if you decide to skip ahead of me and read how the story of Job ends to find an answer there, well, you won&#8217;t find it there either.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes we just have to trust the Lord, especially when we have more questions than answers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Story or real?
