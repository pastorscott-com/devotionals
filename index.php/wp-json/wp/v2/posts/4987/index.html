This is a huge undertaking so he\u2019s organized the leading families of Jerusalem to take on different sections of the wall, including some who are rebuilding the gates to the city. We meet Hanun and his team who are rebuilding the Valley Gate and then we come to Malkijah and his crew. Malkijah is an important person among the returned exiles; in fact, he\u2019s the mayor of the nearby district of Beth Hakkerem.<br \/>\nJust a second, it looks as though Malkijah is taking a short break, maybe we can have a word with him, &#8220;Excuse me, your honor, do you have a second?&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Sure, but not long mind you; there&#8217;s work to be done.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Being such an important person in Jerusalem, I imagine you have an important gate to rebuild. So tell me about this gate\u2026is it one of the historic royal gates, used only for the king?&#8221;<br \/>\nHe smiles and shakes his head.<br \/>\n&#8220;Maybe it\u2019s used for religious purposes, like the Sheep Gate\u2026or for commerce?&#8221;<br \/>\nMalkijah grins at us, &#8220;This, my friends, is none other than the Dung Gate.&#8221;<br \/>\nWe&#8217;re somewhat taken back by this. &#8220;Do you mean this gate is primarily used for human waste disposal?&#8221; We\u2019re surprised that this important man is rebuilding such a lowly gate.<br \/>\nThen Malkijah son of Recab, mayor of Beth Hakkerem says, &#8220;But it is an important gate \u2013 it\u2019s important because it\u2019s being rebuilt in the Name of the Lord. Anything you do in his Name is a worthy effort.&#8221;<br \/>\nAs we rejoin the tour we find ourselves thinking about our attitude toward some of the more lowly things we do in the Name of the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: If the Lord gives us a task, for us, that task is the most important one in the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Dung Gate Nehemiah 3: The Dung Gate itself was rebuilt by Malkijah son of Recab.
