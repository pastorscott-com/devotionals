On the Day of Pentecost the disciples receive, not merely spiritual gifts, but the Gift-giver himself, the Holy Spirit. From that day on, the Holy Spirit has administered the gifts, bestowing them as he deems best, not for individuals, but for the Body of Christ: the Church. When the Spirit decides that the Church needs \u201cwise council\u201d he bestows the gift of counseling on the right person. When he sees the need for healing, he grants someone the gift of healing. If a person sees a healing take place and decides that would be a neat gift to have and starts begging for that gift, they aren\u2019t going to get anywhere. Or, from a different point of view, if a person is given the gift of teaching and decides that their gift is the one everyone needs, well, they\u2019re simply wrong. No individual \u201cowns\u201d their spiritual gift. The Church is the beneficiary of spiritual gifts, but not the dispenser of them. Paul wants the \u201cgift oriented\u201d congregation at Corinth to stop focusing on gifts and to start focusing on the Holy Spirit, acknowledging his authority over the Church. He\u2019ll hand out unique capabilities and enable people to serve in various capacities in the Church as he sees is best. God, the Holy Spirit is in charge, not us.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Let\u2019s be \u201cSpirit-oriented\u201d rather than \u201cgift-oriented.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God at work in the Church 1Corinthians 12: They all originate in God\u2019s Spirit.
