He\u2019s opposed to Christians living self-willed, God-ignoring lives in which we imagine ourselves to be self-sufficient and operating independent of the Lord. He\u2019s not against my making plans and having dreams. At the same time, he\u2019s in favor of my planning and dreaming with an eye toward God. The Lord, himself is a planner, operating on a scale far beyond my comprehension. As an individual created in his image I too plan, thinking about a desirable future and working now to bring it to pass. However, unlike my Heavenly Father, my view is limited and because of that, my expectations are flawed. I remember that I\u2019m to pray for my \u201cdaily bread\u201d trusting the Lord to supply the need of the day. To plan for the future while ignoring God isn\u2019t only foolish. According to James it \u201cis evil.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Ultimately, my future \u2013 my life \u2013 is in God\u2019s hands and not my own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Planning for tomorrow with an eye toward God James 4: You don\u2019t know the first thing about tomorrow.
