However, to do so is a mistake. While the literal situation is foreign to me, the principle Paul teaches here is invaluable. In Corinth there\u2019s lots of idol worship. Often people share a meal with their god, offering some to the idol and then having a party in the god\u2019s honor with the rest of it. A Christian might receive a friendly invitation to the party. That\u2019s where there\u2019s a problem. Some Christians think it is fine to attend, that meat is meat and an idol is nothing anyway. Other Christians are just coming out of that idol worshiping culture. Not too long ago they were the ones dining with the idols and to them eating the idol\u2019s meat is a step backwards into the old way of life. The church at Corinth has been debating this issue and now Paul weighs in on the subject. He tells them that the issue in play isn\u2019t about meat and idols at all. Rather it\u2019s about Christians loving one another. Even if the more mature believer knows that idols are nothing but wood or stone he or she has the responsibility to love their fellow believer who&#8217;s still working through the issue. The principle, then, is that I\u2019m to be willing to give up some of my \u201crights\u201d for the good of my brothers and sisters in Christ. Now, I can\u2019t resist adding here that if you know enough about this that you use this principle as a way to control me (\u201coh, you can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s against my convictions\u201d) then you\u2019re just trying to manipulate me. Thus, you become the one who\u2019s guilty of disregarding this same principle. When all is said and done, I\u2019m still left with the truth that I\u2019m to love you enough to be willing to sacrifice a bit rather than cause you pain. If I fail here, I not only hurt you but I hurt the Lord we both serve.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Love is the guiding principle of Christianity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Giving up a free meal 1Corinthians 8: When you hurt your friend, you hurt Christ.
