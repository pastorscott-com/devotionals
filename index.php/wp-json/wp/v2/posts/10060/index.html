He\u2019s shocked, disgusted, and angered that Christians would drag their disagreements to court to be judged by non-believers. For one thing, it undermines the influence of the gospel. For another, it surrenders God\u2019s way in favor of man\u2019s way. Paul labels this action as \u201cstupid.\u201d This, he declares, isn\u2019t the way Christians are to behave. Someone might respond that it\u2019s the only way they can get justice. The Apostle says that being wronged is better than wounding the cause of Christ. It\u2019s on this point that he makes his most powerful argument on this topic: an action might be legal but that doesn\u2019t make it appropriate for God\u2019s people. Out in the world filing a lawsuit might be considered business as usual, but among God\u2019s people doing such a thing is inappropriate. I think it\u2019s sad that Christians ever part ways. We\u2019re supposed to be branded by our love for one another. If it happens though, we aren\u2019t to handle things the world\u2019s way. As Paul points out, surely there\u2019s someone in the body of Christ that both sides respect. Surely they can turn to them for help in straightening things out. If not, sometimes it\u2019s better to take the short end of the stick and trust God with the long term results. I feel compelled to add here that there are times when Christians are dragged into court against their will, or must seek justice in their dealings with non-believers. At such times we have every right to defend ourselves and seek justice in every legal way possible. In fact, Paul does that in the book of Acts. Even then, though, he concludes that his current legal problems are being used of God to advance his Kingdom. Again, though, just because something\u2019s legal that doesn\u2019t mean that, for the believer, its right.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: God\u2019s people follow a higher way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ll see you in court! 1Corinthians 6: Just because something is technically legal doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s spiritually appropriate.
