He\u2019s a \u201cseasoned\u201d king, 26 years old and with 18 years of leadership under his belt when the Book of God\u2019s Law is brought to him. Instantly, he realizes how much trouble his nation is in. They\u2019ve broken all the laws in the book! The covenant his ancestors made with God had plenty of blessings in it but it had some very serious curses in it as well. Having \u201cbroken the law\u201d they\u2019re destined to face the consequences. Josiah, we\u2019re told, takes this message seriously. He immediately prepares to approach God to ask for a stay of execution. His plan is simple: he\u2019ll commit himself to the covenant that was made years earlier and broken repeatedly by the generations that went before him. The Lord\u2019s impressed with Josiah and his people. The curse is put on hold and Josiah rules a total of thirty-one years. I\u2019m taken today with the mercy and patience of the Lord. Think of God being so forgotten that the Temple which is to be the glorious center of worship is, instead, in a near state of ruin. Think of obedience to his laws being so neglected that that the book of the Law is simply \u201cdiscovered\u201d in those ruins. Then, watch as this young king reads, understands, and pleads with the Lord for mercy. Finally, rejoice as the Lord graciously extends that mercy. No matter how we\u2019ve messed up there\u2019s still hope if we repent and return to this gracious God of Second Chances.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taking God seriously 2 Chronicles 34: The king stood by his pillar and before God solemnly committed himself to the covenant.
