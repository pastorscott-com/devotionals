One of their reasons for doubting is that it\u2019s been so long since the promise was made. Common sense, they think, dictates abandoning belief. People will think, \u201cNothing like that has ever happened since the beginning of time, now so long after the promise, things have continued as they have always been. It\u2019s time to move on and forget about the promise.\u201d Peter gives a three point response to that kind of thinking. First, there\u2019s precedence for God stepping in and changing everything. After all, for eons the universe existed without this planet. Then, God stepped in, bringing about the creation of this very world. Later on, in Noah\u2019s day, God changed everything again by bringing to pass a great flood. Here are two prime examples of God intervening in Creation to do a new thing. Second, time matters a lot more to us than it does to the Eternal One. A thousand years is a lot of time for humanity, but it\u2019s a blink of the eye for the Ancient of Days. Third, God has reason to wait. That reason is that he wants to give more generations opportunity to be redeemed. The Lord wants to save people; all the people he can save. Therefore, he\u2019s patient, taking all the time necessary to get as many in as he can. The Day of Judgment is definitely coming. Jesus will return and that will set the whole End of Time in motion. Meanwhile, we wait with the understanding that God knows exactly what he\u2019s doing and at just the right time Jesus will come back. My job is to get ready, to stay ready, and to help all who will to prepare for that certain upheaval of history.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: No doubt about it, Jesus is coming back.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why it\u2019s taking so long for Jesus to come back 2Peter 3: So what\u2019s happened to the promise of his Coming?
