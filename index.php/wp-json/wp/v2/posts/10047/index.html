Paul says that while the descendants of Abraham are the people with the promise of God that promise remains under God\u2019s control. Even among Abraham\u2019s descendants some are excluded and have no part in the promise. For instance, twin brothers (Jacob and Esau), before they\u2019re ever born are treated differently from one another by God. One will be part of what God is doing in the world and the other won\u2019t. Some Israelites have the idea that salvation is uniquely theirs because of their lineage. Paul says that\u2019s not how it is. The only real decision maker here is God, so when some of Abraham\u2019s descendants have tried to take the ball and run with it, making salvation their personal property, they\u2019ve run head first into the Almighty who reminds them that this is his doing and not theirs. Israel doesn\u2019t own salvation \u2013 God does. This is Good News for those of us who would otherwise be considered outsiders and ineligible for this wonderful plan of salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: There\u2019s a wideness in God\u2019s mercy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been included Romans 9: They were so absorbed in their \u201cGod projects\u201d that they didn\u2019t notice God right in front of them.
