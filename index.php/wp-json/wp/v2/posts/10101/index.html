New Church not only offers a different style of music, but there\u2019s a lot of talk about amazing spiritual experiences and hitherto unknown secrets being revealed.  The folks at First Church can\u2019t help but notice what\u2019s going on down the street.  How come their pastor never tells them some of these secrets to success?  Why doesn\u2019t he lead them into the mysteries of the spiritual?  Something like that is happening at Colossi and Laodicea.  Those with a different approach to God have come to town claiming that their way unlocks doors that have before been locked.  If the Christians listen to them they can go beyond where they are and press on to spiritual power and authority beyond what they&#8217;ve ever imagined.  The Apostle tells them that that\u2019s completely wrong.  The great mystery, the wonderful secret to spiritual power and success has already been explained to them.  It can all be summed up in one name: \u201cJesus.\u201d  To be connected to him is to be connected to all there is of God.  He warns them that to rush off down some other road is a \u201cwild-goose chase.\u201d  Paul urges them to focus only on Jesus and, in him to be dominated by the love of God.  The mystery has been solved and the secret has been revealed.  His name is Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Our religion isn\u2019t bound up in mysteries.  Rather it\u2019s all about relationship: knowing Jesus as Savior, Lord, and Friend.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The mystery has been solved Colossians 2: We\u2019ve been shown the mystery!
