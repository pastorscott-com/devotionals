Instead of being personally present, guiding them to the Promised Land, the Lord is going to assign that job to an angel.  These Israelites, the Lord says, are a hard-headed people and they might just push too hard against God and be destroyed because of it.  In response, Moses has another meeting with the Lord as the Pillar of Cloud descends on the Tabernacle.  As Abraham interceded for the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah centuries earlier, Moses begins to deal with the Almighty.  He reminds the Lord that it was the Lord, himself, who called him from tending sheep to lead these people.  He doesn\u2019t want to settle for an angel.  Instead, he wants the presence of the Lord, himself, on his life and on the lives of the Israelites.  In desperate insistence, Moses declares, \u201cIf your presence doesn\u2019t take the lead here, call this trip off right now&#8230;.are you traveling with us or not?\u201d  In the face of this intercession the Lord relents.  It won\u2019t be an angel who travels with the Israelites; it will be the Lord, himself.  I have some theological issues with this whole exchange.  After all, isn\u2019t the Lord everywhere, all the time?  Still, I\u2019m drawn to this exchange between Moses and the Lord.  As wonderful as an angelic visitation might be, it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the very presence of the Lord in my life.  As Moses indicates, he doesn\u2019t want to take a single step without the Lord.  As I rise in the morning and enter into my day I want to do so in the spirit of Moses: I don\u2019t want to say a word, to do a deed, to walk a step without the Lord in my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: I want to live in constant fellowship with the Lord, every step of the way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Walking with the Lord Exodus 33: If your presence doesn\u2019t take the lead here, call this trip off right now.
