I think I&#8217;ll retreat to my devotional approach for the time being.  Ezekiel&#8217;s commission is similar to that of Jeremiah.  The Lord warns him that the people he&#8217;s going to speak to aren&#8217;t likely to listen to his message.  Ezekiel is to proclaim just what he&#8217;s told to proclaim and not worry about the results.  As I find this theme I first found in Jeremiah being repeated here I can&#8217;t help but think about free will.  Jeremiah pled with his people to listen and return to God and thus divert the disaster that was promised.  In spite of his faithful proclamation, the bottom line was that people could respond or not.  Now that the catastrophe has come, the Lord raises up a prophet to the exiles, giving him similar instructions.  He&#8217;s to reach out to these rebellious people while knowing that they&#8217;ll probably not respond.  The Lord tells Ezekiel it&#8217;s his job to do the preaching and that he has to leave the results in the hands of those who can accept or reject his message.  A couple of things come to mind.  First, I see the absolute value God places on free will.  He won&#8217;t negate it even for my own good.  Second, I see the amazing love and grace of the Almighty.  Even when he sees that his invitation to mercy is likely to be rejected he insists on reaching out anyway.   Also, the Lord&#8217;s quite willing to enlist us to this task.  Still my responsibility ends with my obedience to the Lord, for those to whom I\u2019m sent that&#8217;s where their responsibility begins.<br \/>\nTake Away: All anyone can do is to obey the Lord \u2013 the results are out of our hands.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Faithful to the task Ezekiel 2: Whether they listen is not your concern.
