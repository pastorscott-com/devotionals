Freed from bondage they\u2019re now on the way to the Promised Land.  This is the land God promised to their ancestor, Abraham.  Moses is their leader yet God provides even more direct guidance.  He guides them with a daytime cloud and a nighttime fire in the sky.  When the pillar moves, they move.  When it stands still, they stand still.  What could be easier?  Honestly, I kind of envy them, don\u2019t you?  Who could ask for a more clear way to know God\u2019s plan.  Still, as I think about it, I realize that many years later Jesus promises a \u201cpillar\u201d of his own.   One of his last words of instruction to his disciples contains the promise of the Holy Spirit who will be their Guide.  Instead of scanning the horizon to follow a pillar of cloud (have you ever wondered how that worked on a rainy day or during a nighttime thunderstorm?) the disciples will have an Inner Guide directing their lives.  And it won\u2019t be a case of God dragging them along in directions they don\u2019t want to go either (remember, even with the pillars, there are an abundance of spiritual failures coming).  This Guide, promised by Jesus, transforms hearts &#8212; changing his followers at the heart level.  He not only guides; he also enables us to follow.  It isn\u2019t a pillar of fire but it is a wonderful way to be led by the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Holy Spirit is our \u201cpillar of fire.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Divine Guidance Exodus 13: The Pillar of Cloud by day and the Pillar of Fire by night never left the people.
