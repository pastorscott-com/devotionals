Every year Easter and Christmas came around and I felt challenged to come up with some innovative way to preach sermons on them. I was especially challenged by \u201ccivil\u201d calendar events like Mother\u2019s Day and Independence Day. Ultimately, I arrived at a two sided solution. For Father\u2019s Day and the like, I don\u2019t preach on the day, but acknowledge and observe it early in the service. Then, having done that, we move on to a regular worship event. \u201cSpiritual\u201d calendar events, though, need to be highlighted. I was still left with the challenge of preaching a sermon that would help people better process the meaning of the day. Finally, the Lord seemed to have mercy on this struggling preacher. It dawned on me that spiritual events come around as reminders. I don\u2019t need to \u201cdress them up\u201d with some impressive new approach. Instead, I need to go back to the basics and retell the story. From that point on, I prepared sermons for those days with a sense of freedom. As I read this passage from 2Peter today I see that he set the example for me and countless spiritual leaders through the centuries. He tells his readers that some things need to be said again and again and that, to some extent, if the leader is successful in keeping people reminded of basic spiritual truths that leader has been successful, fulfilling his or her God-given assignment.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We never progress to the point that we don\u2019t need to be reminded of foundational spiritual truths.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Retelling the old story 2Peter 1: This is the post to which I\u2019ve been assigned\u2014keeping you alert with frequent reminders.
