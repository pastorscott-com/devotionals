Over the years God blessed them and now they can no longer say, \u201cSilver and gold have I none.\u201d  Still, in a real sense they continue to have nothing of their own.

As plans are being made to build a House of Worship it only makes sense that they return a portion of that which has been entrusted to them that the planned building might be constructed.  The people come through with wonderful generosity and David prays that this giving spirit might always be seen in their lives.  The result of all this is the Temple.  Also, there\u2019s a wonderful spirit of celebration.
