It\u2019s springtime and the king is off to war.  From here, we move forward to a few accounts of the victories won by David and his army, including more battles with big guys similar to Goliath.  Apparently, the writer thinks that we\u2019ll all agree that there\u2019s a time for national leaders to lead their nations into war.  David lives in an imperfect day in which some nations are belligerent against other nations.  If he relaxes, enjoying the success the Lord has given him, the enemies of Israel will move to wipe them off the face of the map.  Therefore, when the weather is right, David\u2019s army gears up for war, knowing that if they don\u2019t they\u2019ll be erased by those who wish them dead.  That\u2019s a long time ago and the world has changed, right?  You know that aside from the fact that armies no longer wait till spring to do battle that the world remains a dangerous place.  I know I can\u2019t take a passing phrase from 1 Chronicles to develop a philosophy of international relationships, but I do think that this is an example of a national leader doing what\u2019s necessary to keep his nation safe and secure.  As a people of God we hate war; especially the pain and suffering it brings to the innocent.  It would be better if \u201cspringtime\u201d never came, but we know it will and because of that we regrettably conclude that a primary responsibility of national leaders is to prepare for war and, while all that is possible to avoid war, to respond when necessary.<br \/>\nTake Away: We need to pray for our national leaders.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Springtime always comes 1 Chronicles 20: That spring, the time when kings usually go off to war&#8230;.
