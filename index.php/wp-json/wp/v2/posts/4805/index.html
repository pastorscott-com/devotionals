Leaders can\u2019t force morality but they can model it. Beyond that, leaders, even especially powerful ones, must give account of themselves to Almighty God. Still, Jeroboam has some successes: military victories that win back territory that&#8217;s been lost to their enemies. We\u2019re told here that God is helping Jeroboam do that, not because he favors this pitiful king but for his own purposes. Although the day of destruction and defeat is coming, for now the Lord isn&#8217;t ready for Israel to be defeated. Because of that he helps Jeroboam lead Israel in some specific ways. This is good for Israel. Still though, Jeroboam will face a God who\u2019s displeased with him. I see here that even though God acts according to his own agenda it doesn&#8217;t get people off the hook when they fail of their own free will.<br \/>\nTake Away: Ultimately, we will each give account of ourselves to the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leadership and accountability 2Kings 14: God wasn&#8217;t yet ready to blot out the name of Israel from history, so he used Jeroboam son of Jehoash to save them.
