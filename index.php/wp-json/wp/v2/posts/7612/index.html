I can imagine the cheers of agreement from his fellow countrymen as he does this.  They have bones to pick with Tyre and Edom and Moab.  Nothing pleases them more than hearing God pronounce his judgment on them.  Then God\u2019s man turns his attention to Israel.  The formula \u201cfor three great sins, make that four\u201d that was used in judging other countries is applied to Israel too.  The meaning is that the more God looks into their affairs the more he finds wrong and worthy of condemnation.  Concerning Israel, in particular, all the failures God mentions are clustered around how they treat poor people.  The Lord charges that they see people as only \u201cthings \u2013 ways of making money,\u201d he then adds, \u201cThey\u2019d sell their own grandmother!\u201d  The Lord has a history of caring about people who are down and out.  He also has a history of opposing those who take advantage of such people.  As I read these words I find myself examining my own attitude toward the poor.  I want to be on God\u2019s side of this issue.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord cares for those who are society\u2019s outcasts \u2013 his people are to join him in that concern.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Selling grandma for a buck Amos 2: They\u2019d sell their own grandmother.
