In fact, this is the first of three such collections, the last being some of Solomon&#8217;s own gems.  Clearly this wise man is not only a source of wisdom but is a collector of it too.  The proverb concerning gambling catches my eye today as gambling is everywhere in our culture.  Several states have turned to casinos as an answer to financial shortfalls.  Also, there are many state sponsored lotteries.   It isn&#8217;t unusual to be approached by someone selling raffle tickets in support of some worthy cause. (If I think it is truly worthy, I make a donation but decline taking a ticket.)  When I turn on the TV I find shows about poker games.  It\u2019s clear that our society is awash with gambling.  This isn&#8217;t how people of faith are supposed to operate.  My hope isn\u2019t that by taking a chance I can get hold of the money of other people who have taken the same chance.  The life of faith isn\u2019t about getting all I can from anywhere I can.  Rather than gambling on my future by guessing the right lotto numbers I can stake my future on the solid rock of God&#8217;s faithfulness to me.  Jesus said it\u2019s impossible to serve both God and money.  In this proverb, I see the wisdom of avoiding the gambling trap.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our hope is in the Lord, not in picking the right lotto numbers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trust in God, not in chance Proverbs 22: Don&#8217;t gamble on the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, hocking your house against a lucky chance.
