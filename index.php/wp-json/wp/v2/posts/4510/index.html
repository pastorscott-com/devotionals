In one battle 4,000 men of Israel are killed. What can they do to turn the tide? Someone has the idea of bringing the sacred Ark of the Covenant to the battle lines. Like the fictional German officers in the Indiana Jones movie these ancient Israelites think the Ark has power of its own that can be controlled by whoever possesses it. As the Chest arrives at the camp everyone cheers. Now they have the Power of God at their disposal and nothing will stop them. However, it doesn\u2019t work out that way. On one hand, the Almighty clearly has an interest in the Ark of the Covenant. As the story continues that becomes abundantly clear. On the other hand, God is in authority over the Ark rather than the other way around. Bringing the Ark to battle doesn\u2019t guarantee victory. They need God much more than they need the Chest. Today, as I read this story I\u2019m reminded that in spite of the Indiana Jones movie, the Ark hasn\u2019t been located and even if it was there\u2019s not much chance that it could be used as a secret weapon now any more than it was in this story from the Bible. In my life, the key to spiritual power isn\u2019t in my waving my Bible around or in my wearing a cross on a string around my neck or in my being anointed with oil. As it was with the Ark, those things may have value, but they\u2019re nothing in and of themselves. It\u2019s God who I need and I\u2019m wise to remember that no matter how many props I come up with he won\u2019t be manipulated.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is real and he insists I treat him as something other than some unseen force to manipulate to get my own way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God won\u2019t be manipulated 1 Samuel 4: When the Chest of the Covenant of God was brought into the camp, everyone gave a huge cheer.
