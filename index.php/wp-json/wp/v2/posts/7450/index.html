The Lord tells his prophet that his wife is about to die but as an object lesson for the people he&#8217;s not to publicly mourn her death.  By the time of this event Ezekiel is well known for his messages of God&#8217;s anger with his people.  He&#8217;s also known for &#8220;acting out&#8221; some event as an object lesson.  When his wife dies and Ezekiel just goes on with his preaching everyone knows there&#8217;s an object lesson in it.  They gather round this broken man and ask him why he isn&#8217;t mourning the loss of the love of his life.  It&#8217;s then that he warns them that even as his beloved has been taken from him their beloved city and Temple are going to be taken and, even as he&#8217;s not gone through a mourning process their enemies won&#8217;t give them even a moment to mourn the loss of it all.  I can hardly imagine what it was like for Ezekiel that day as God&#8217;s message had to take precedence over his personal loss.  Earlier in his ministry the Lord promised to stiffen Ezekiel that he could face all the rejection that was coming, so maybe that&#8217;s in play here.  Another thing I can hardly imagine is how God could love these hard people so much as to keep reaching out to them, calling them to himself in such drastic ways.  Finally, I don&#8217;t think Ezekiel&#8217;s situation can be viewed as typical of God&#8217;s servants.  On one hand, I&#8217;m reminded of what it means to be surrendered to the Lord; that it can take us to places we never would go otherwise.  On the other hand, I remember that this is a very unique situation in the Bible and can&#8217;t be viewed as how the Lord usually deals with us.  Of course, the Lord asks noting of Ezekiel that he doesn&#8217;t require of himself.  Even as God&#8217;s Only Begotten Son dies on the cross, he&#8217;ll have to turn his back on him.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord loves lost people so much that he\u2019ll act in extreme ways to redeem them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The death of Ezekiel\u2019s wife Ezekiel 24: Get dressed as usual and go about your work &#8212; none of the usual funeral rituals.
