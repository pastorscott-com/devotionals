Ahaz can hardly believe it. His nation is out manned and out gunned by the invaders. Isaiah tells him to ask for a sign, any sign, and it will be given him. However, Ahaz\u2019s lack of faith is apparent when he off handedly says, \u201cOh, I won\u2019t do that.\u201d Isaiah tells him that the Lord&#8217;s displeased with his refusal to even bother asking for a sign, but that one will be given anyway. It&#8217;s here that we get into \u201cvirgin birth\u201d talk. However, the promise isn\u2019t for the Messiah to come, it has to do with current circumstances. Isaiah says that before a girl, now a virgin, can marry, conceive, and give birth (in other words, a poetic way of saying \u201cnine months\u201d) that those armies attacking Judah will be gone. To underscore the reason for this withdrawal the child could properly be named \u201cImmanuel\u201d or \u201cGod-With-Us.\u201d Isaiah goes on to express God\u2019s displeasure with Ahaz but, still, the bottom line remains. When all else is \u201csaid and done\u201d \u201cImmanuel\u201d remains true, God is with us. When Christ is born this incident comes to mind and is played out in a very literal way. This time it is literally a virgin who gives birth, and this time it really is God who is with us. In these related incidents we see the dual nature of prophecy as there&#8217;s a very current application that&#8217;s echoed in an unimaginable way in a more distant future. We also see that, today, we can grasp this wonderful truth at a level Isaiah could hardly imagine: God is with us indeed.<br \/>\nTake Away: How wonderful to be reminded of Immanuel God-is-with-us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Virgin Birth Isaiah 8: Because when all is said and done, the last word is Immanuel&#8211;God-With-Us.
