He doesn&#8217;t need Zophar to lecture him.  In fact Job already believes all the things his friend has said.  Beyond that, Job assures him that everyone believes that stuff.  Since Zophar and Job believe the same thing (that bad things only happen to bad people) Job again turns his attention to God.  He wants to know exactly what sins have been charged against him.  Perhaps there needs to be an audit of God\u2019s bookkeeping system so the error against Job can be found.  Still, even as he pleads with God to tell him what he\u2019s done wrong, Job&#8217;s reminded of the uncomfortable fact of the unfairness of life in general.  It may be that Job has never admitted this to himself before.  It\u2019s only as he sits here in absolute misery listening to his friends saying all the same things he\u2019s said many times that he acknowledges that life isn&#8217;t as neatly ordered as he has believed.  Both good and bad people alike have plenty of trouble come to their lives.  It seems to Job that even a lowly ditch digger gets a day off once in a while.  Shouldn&#8217;t God make life easy for human beings who only have a short life anyway?  And, since our lives are so limited, is there something more, beyond this life?  Job has no Easter story to draw from, but even in this distant day, he\u2019s considering the possibility of life after death as a way God might &#8220;balance the books&#8221; of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: We know more about this than Job does; that ultimately the Lord will set all things right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Life after death?
