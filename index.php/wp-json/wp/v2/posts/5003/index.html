Don&#8217;t feel bad. The joy of God is your strength!<br \/>\nMany of those listening to Ezra read and explain the Scripture this day left the land of their birth to return to this land of their ancestors. They left family and friends, security and comfort to go to an unsecured city that wasn\u2019t a city at all; rather, it was a pile of rubble. They made the hazardous journey to Jerusalem and then braved real opposition as they labored to rebuild the wall and prepared to re-occupy the City of David. As this task is completed, a holy event is planned. Governor Nehemiah and Priest Ezra organize an event centered on the Word of the Lord. However, something unexpected happens as Ezra reads and explains the Scripture to them. These good people begin to weep and wail. The sense of celebration is replaced with a feeling of failure and fear. The leaders have to act quickly or this holy day will turn in to a day of mourning. Why is it that the people react as they do? I think it\u2019s because they begin to grasp the enormity of their sins and that of their forefathers. Generations earlier, King Josiah responds in the same way when the Book of God is found in the Temple. As he hears it read he\u2019s alarmed and responds in humble fear of God. There\u2019s a place for this kind of response to God&#8217;s Word. In fact, I need to be fearful and heartbroken when I realize my sin. However, the story must never end here. The Word of God is not intended to condemn me. Instead, it\u2019s to be for me a wonderful message of hope. I\u2019ve failed God and should stand condemned but God is gracious and offers me hope. The bad news is that I\u2019ve sinned against God. The good news is that he\u2019s the God of Second Chances graciously offering me and you hope and restoration.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Second Chances Nehemiah 8: This is a day holy to God.
