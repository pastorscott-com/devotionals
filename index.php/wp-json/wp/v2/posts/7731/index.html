Habakkuk, who lives 600 years before Jesus is born, brings a different perspective to the ministry of the prophets.  His messages start, not with a word from the Lord, but with questions for the Lord.  While Habakkuk isn\u2019t the only one to follow this path (we see it a lot in the Psalms) it does set him apart from the average approach of his fellow minor prophets.  There\u2019s some complaining to God in his writings.  Habakkuk speaks from his heart as he tries to understand how a righteous God could possibly use an unrighteousness people like the Babylonians to do his will in punishing Israel.  This little book is a good one to read when it appears that bad people are getting away with their sin.  It\u2019s also a good one to help us work through the unwelcome \u201csilent God\u201d times of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s okay to be absolutely honest with the Lord in expressing our disappointment or confusion to him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Silent God Habakkuk 1: God, how long do I have to cry out for help?
