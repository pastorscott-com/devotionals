But that may be the problem.  Many of his listeners had not even been born when the bread started falling.  A person in his audience can be 40 years old and every day (except on Saturdays) of his or her life they have gone out to collect manna to eat.  These blessed people have never seen it any other way.  Had you met one and asked them about their clothing: &#8220;Say, how long does a shirt last before it has to be replaced?&#8221;  The response would have been one of confusion: &#8220;What do you mean, &#8216;last&#8217; &#8212; I don&#8217;t understand the question.&#8221;  Why?  Because their clothing never needed to be replaced &#8212; ever! Is it possible that God can be so good to me that I forget that he&#8217;s the Source of the blessing in the first place?   Once I forget the Source, the next step is for me to start thinking that I somehow deserve credit for it.  Moses says that if I start thinking like that &#8212; well, I&#8217;d better think again.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s okay to enjoy the blessing as long as I remember the Source of the blessing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deliverance, protection, provision Deuteronomy 8: If you start thinking to yourselves, &#8220;I did all this.
