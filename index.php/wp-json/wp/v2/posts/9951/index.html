After becoming a follower of Jesus, Levi throws a party in the Lord\u2019s honor. He invites all his friends to come to the feast and to meet Jesus. Apparently, Jesus is right at home with this crowd and that catches the attention of some of the religious leaders. In their opinion and practice, holy people don\u2019t associate with sinners out of fear that some of their sin might rub off on them. It would be one thing for Jesus to shake his finger in their faces, telling them what bad people they are. However, Jesus apparently actually likes these people and is at home with them. He tells them that he\u2019s like a doctor who lovingly cares for his patients and ends up spending more time with sick people than healthy people. I wonder what role I play in this story. On one hand, I\u2019m one of Levi\u2019s friends, unworthy of being loved by God yet loved still. On the other hand, I fear I\u2019m one of the religious leaders who are quite comfortable hanging out with other religious folk, but not really at home with spiritually needy people. The real goal is to be more like Jesus who loves people and is willing to make himself at home with even sinners that he might show them the way to God. Every time I say, \u201cI just don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t go to church\u201d I identify with the religious leaders rather than with Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christians should love sinners and enjoy their company and, at the same time, be ready to offer them real hope of life change.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Make yourself at home Mark 2: I\u2019m here inviting the sin-sick, not the spiritually-fat.
