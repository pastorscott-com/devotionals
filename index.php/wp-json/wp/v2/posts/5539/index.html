Jeremiah says that the Lord wonders why they don&#8217;t look at all of it and ask, &#8220;How can we honor our God with our lives?&#8221;  However, that doesn&#8217;t happen.  Instead, we see God-insulting sin and rebellion.  It\u2019s no wonder the Lord\u2019s sick of them!  After all he&#8217;s done for them they\u2019ve turned their backs on him and walked away.  God&#8217;s response is to do the same.  He\u2019ll be the one walking away and they\u2019ll pay a terrible price for their insulting attitude toward him.  Frankly, this passage troubles me.  It would be easier to skip ahead to more sunshine and bypass this gloom and doom.  That, though, is the problem.  I&#8217;d better listen to Jeremiah.  God takes being ignored personally.  He blesses us in many wonderful ways but he expects us to respond to that blessing by honoring him in our lives.  I may not be able to influence the larger culture but I\u2019d better take this stuff to heart.  Beyond that, I need to use what influence I do have to remind people that God expects us to respond to his blessings and never take him, or them, for granted.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord takes being ignored personally.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God takes being ignored personally Jeremiah 5: Why don&#8217;t you honor me?
