These residents of Canaan are cruel, child sacrificing, warring peoples, but some unite in an effort to stop the advance of Joshua and his army.  The battle that ensues is a momentous one.  In one fight they&#8217;ll either gain a decisive advantage or be beaten back.  It\u2019s during this battle that Joshua asks for an unbelievable favor from God.  He asks that the sun stand still so that they can continue to fight while they have the advantage.  God answers and the sun stops in the sky as the battle rages.  Of course, the impossibility of that actually happening is clearer to me than it is to Joshua, who doesn&#8217;t understand anything at all about the solar system.  I&#8217;m no scientist, but I know that if the sun stood still that it would mean the earth quit rotating, and if the earth stopped turning\u2026well, it would be the end of the world.  Needless to say, I would never pray the prayer Joshua prayed &#8212; I&#8217;m too educated to do that.  But here we have poor, ignorant Joshua asking for something that couldn&#8217;t possibly happen.  What&#8217;s that?  You say that the Bible says it did happen?  Listen, I have no idea of how God could stop the sun in the sky without the entire solar system crashing.  It\u2019s such a big miracle that I, even with my limited knowledge, could never pray for it.  Joshua doesn&#8217;t know that the earth is round and is spinning and is orbiting around the sun.  All he knows is that he needs a miracle from God.  And that, my friend, is the whole point.  Sometimes I need to throw out all the facts and hold on to the only real Fact, God, Himself.  I need to be careful that I&#8217;m not so &#8220;smart&#8221; that God can&#8217;t do for me what he wants to do. Take Away: God specializes in doing the impossible and he doesn\u2019t need for me to explain to him what he can or can\u2019t do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stopping the sun Joshua 10: The sun stopped in its tracks in mid sky; just sat there all day.
