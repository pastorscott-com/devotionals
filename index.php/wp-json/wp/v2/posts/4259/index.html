Both priests and people are to prepare themselves for this event by fasting.  The High Priest is to follow a precise ritual and on this day only he is to enter the most sacred part of the Tabernacle, the Holy of Holies.  Here, in the Presence of the Lord his, and the sins of the whole nation, will be cleansed.  Once this is done a great celebration of thanksgiving takes place.  I find it interesting that after all the sin offerings with all the shed blood that there remains the need for a specific encounter with the Almighty for their sins to be wiped out.  In this I see that, in the end, these ancient Israelites rely, as I do, on the grace and mercy of God.  As this High Priest in his colorful and strange garb prepares to enter the most holy place on the face of the earth, I think of my own approach to the Throne of God.  When the Priest comes in humility the result is cleansing from sin.  It\u2019s also that way for you and me.  We approach the throne humbly but in expectation of receiving grace, mercy, forgiveness, and cleansing.  It\u2019s only in the presence of God that we are made clean of all our sins.<br \/>\nTake Away: When all else is said and done, we rely on God\u2019s grace and mercy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Day of Atonement Leviticus 16: In the presence of God you will be made clean of all your sins.
