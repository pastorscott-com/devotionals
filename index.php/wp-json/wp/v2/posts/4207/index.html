Dedicate your firstborn sons to me.<br \/>\nIf anyone thinks the Law given at Mount Sinai is all about the Ten Commandments or at least is filled with regulations concerning their religion they need to spend some time in the second half of the Book of Exodus.  The regulations stated here are a mulligan stew of civil, personal, and religious rules and regulations.  The Lord\u2019s just as interested in telling them how to settle a property dispute as he is in telling them how to conduct a worship service.  For instance, he tells them that as they prosper in the land he&#8217;s giving them that they\u2019re to live generous lives.  Then, in the very next sentence he tells them that they\u2019re to dedicate their firstborn sons to him.  For these people, there\u2019s to be no difference between their \u201creligious\u201d lives and their \u201csecular\u201d lives.  Instead, they\u2019re to live their \u201cwhole lives\u201d under the authority of God.  Refraining from eating the meat of some dead animal they find in the field and making sacrifices only to the Lord God are both filed under the heading of \u201cbe holy.\u201d  A lesson for me in all this is that my life as a whole is to be lived under the authority of the Lord.  I\u2019m to live a generous, honest, compassionate life.  Not only am I to dedicate my children to the Lord, but, as my \u201cwine vats fill up\u201d I\u2019m to be a generous person, sharing the blessing the Lord has given me.  The two, secular and religious, are really just one, living as one of God\u2019s people.<br \/>\nTake Away: My entire life is to be lived as a person of God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living as one of God\u2019s people Exodus 22: Don\u2019t be stingy as your wine vats fill up.
