Here\u2019s a good man. In spite of his physical domination and naturally handsome good looks he\u2019s humble. We meet him taking care of his father\u2019s business, looking for some lost donkeys, but also concerned that his father might be worried about him. When it\u2019s suggested that he visit the man of God, Samuel, and ask for help in locating the animals, he goes with offering in hand. When I read this introduction to Saul I\u2019m impressed with him. He has the potential of being a terrific leader of Israel who\u2019ll guide the people to a close, faithful walk with the Lord. As I begin reading the story of Saul I find no reason to expect failure on his part. Instead, everything\u2019s in place for success at every level of his life. In choosing him, the Lord isn\u2019t setting him up for failure. Instead, Saul\u2019s being set up for success. That\u2019s true, too, I think, in the lives of followers of Jesus. No one is saved to ultimately fail. In fact, success is guaranteed by the blood of Jesus. The only way my spiritual journey can end badly is if I sabotage it myself. Sorry to say we\u2019re about to see an illustration of that from this capable young man.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord gives us everything we need to live for him and then live with him in eternity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Self-sabotage 1 Samuel 9: He had a son, Saul, a most handsome young man&#8230;he literally stood head and shoulders above the crowd!
