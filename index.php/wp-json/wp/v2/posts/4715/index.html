This is a serious sin with real consequences. God sends a prophet to declare his judgment. The man is faithful to the task, accomplishes his mission, and is on his way home when a fellow catches up to him, inviting him to stay and eat. The reply is that he can&#8217;t do that. God gave him specific orders about this: &#8220;don&#8217;t eat a crumb and don&#8217;t drink a drop.&#8221; The reply is that the prospective host has received a word from the Lord too. He\u2019s been told that it\u2019s okay for the prophet to come to his house for some hospitality. The Bible says that &#8220;the man was lying.&#8221; Hard to imagine isn&#8217;t it? How could anyone say, &#8220;The Lord told me&#8221; when they just want to get their own way? Well, come to think of it, it isn&#8217;t hard to imagine at all! People do it all the time. Sometimes they\u2019re religious fanatics who are perverting God&#8217;s Word. Sometimes they\u2019re well-meaning people who simply have a hard time telling the difference between what they want and what God says. In this case a good man, a prophet of God listens. As a result, he loses his life. On one side of this issue, I want to be careful I don&#8217;t attach &#8220;God says&#8221; to what &#8220;I want.&#8221; It\u2019s okay for me to have opinions and desires, but I need to be honest with others and myself and not use God&#8217;s name &#8220;in vain&#8221; by saying &#8220;God told me&#8221; when I&#8217;m just saying what I want. On the other side of the issue, I need to get used to hearing God&#8217;s Voice in my life. Once I learn to listen to what he\u2019s saying others who say, &#8220;God told me to tell you&#8230;&#8221; won&#8217;t easily sidetrack me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Saying \u201cGod said\u2026\u201d when it\u2019s really \u201cI want\u201d is, in a sense, taking the name of the Lord in vain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not all free meals are free 1Kings 13: An angel came to me with a message from God&#8230;but the man was lying.
