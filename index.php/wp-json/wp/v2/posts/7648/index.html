Think of it, after all the serious exploration and all the visits of tourists there exists a creature that no one has ever spotted before, or at least no one who recognized that this is a unique creature.   When the sailors reluctantly toss Jonah into the water neither he nor they have any idea of what God has in store for this reluctant prophet.  God sends a big fish to swallow him whole.  Now, it may be that this is a whale that has a birth defect that traps air in its stomach.  It may be that this is a \u201cDesigner model\u201d of fish \u2013 one of a kind and made for this specific purpose.  Folks who laugh at this story and discard it as impossible ignore all the \u201cimpossibilities\u201d of life, stuff we take for granted that if they weren\u2019t right in front of us we\u2019d declare to be fantasy.  The story of Jonah may be a fable started in another culture and appropriated by God\u2019s people as a platform for teaching us about God.  On the other hand, it may be \u201cjust the facts\u201d retold generation to generation to teach us about God.  Either way the end result is the same.  I think I\u2019ll just let the story stand as factual and get on to what I\u2019m supposed to learn from it.<br \/>\nTake Away: Every day and all around us we encounter \u201cimpossibilities\u201d that might be called \u201cordinary miracles.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>That big fish Jonah 1: Jonah was in the fish\u2019s belly three days and nights.
