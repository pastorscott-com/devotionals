Don\u2019t let anyone put you down.<\/p>\n<p>Here in Crete Titus is operating in new territory. He\u2019s been part of Paul\u2019s team, traveling from place to place. Sometimes he\u2019s gone out on special assignment, delivering a message or the like, but still operating under Paul\u2019s wing. Now, though, things are different. Yes, he\u2019s been appointed by Paul to this task, but, by and large he\u2019s on his own. The Apostle reminds him of what he\u2019s supposed to do, but this time, it\u2019s Titus, by himself, meeting with congregations and organizing their leadership. It may be that Paul knows Titus well enough to know that he\u2019s going to struggle a bit with this assignment. Even as he spells out Titus\u2019 responsibilities Paul makes it a point to tell him that he\u2019s in charge and as he meets with these budding congregations he needs to be ready to stand his ground concerning the kind of leaders they need and the kind of people they\u2019re supposed to be. Here, again, I find myself considering a leadership principle. Humbleness is critical if one is to be the servant-leader Christian leaders are called to be. At the same time though, if one has been called to and granted authority for leadership by the Lord, that individual needs to have a firm grasp on that leadership. Most everyone recognizes God-called leadership. The thing is that while most recognize and appreciate it, a few are threatened by it and will challenge or manipulate it if they think they can get away with it. A Christian leader must recognize this and be ready to stand firm in his or her calling in a Christ-like manner.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christian leaders are servant-leaders, but they do carry with them a sense of authority.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being the leader God calls one to be Titus 2: You\u2019re in charge.
