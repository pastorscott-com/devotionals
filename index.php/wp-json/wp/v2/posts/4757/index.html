He now has a faithful assistant, Elisha, and a band of disciples. Generally, he stays out of sight. However, he remains a household name in Israel. You might say he\u2019s bigger than life. Now that Ahab is dead, his son, Ahaziah rules Israel. However, things aren&#8217;t going well for him. Moab has rebelled against the rule of Israel and, to top it off, Ahaziah has taken a nasty fall and been injured. The ailing king sends messengers to seek a remedy for his injuries, not to Jehovah God, but to the idol Baal. It\u2019s as they travel to Ekron to visit the Baal shrine that they encounter the old man Elijah, shaggy hair, leather belt and all. The Lord, he says, is angry with Ahaziah for turning to Baal as though he doesn&#8217;t exist and because of that Ahaziah is on what will become his deathbed. When they return with the message and describe the man who gave it, Ahaziah knows that Elijah has stepped out onto the public stage once again. Repeated attempts to arrest him result in fire falling from heaven. Clearly, it\u2019s unwise to trifle with this man of God! Aside from his unusual appearance (and, come to think of it, the lightning strikes on his enemies), Elijah reminds me of some spiritual giants I\u2019ve known. These are people who don&#8217;t make a big deal of themselves, who seem out of step with what most of us think of as &#8220;normal,&#8221; but spend a lot of time in the presence of God. When they have something to say, we\u2019re wise to listen.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes people who seem out of step with the world are very much in step with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Marching to the beat of their own drummer 2Kings1: That has to be Elijah the Tishbite!
