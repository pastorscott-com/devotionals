When forty or more men take an oath to kill Paul the Romans take action similar what has been done before; they move him out of town.  Paul, at the center of this whole storm, is surprisingly calm and filled with hope.  Why?  It\u2019s because he\u2019s heard from the Lord that \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d  His confinement has just begun and things will get worse.  How many times will he return in spirit to that night at the Roman garrison in Jerusalem when the Master, himself, came to encourage him?  This visitation of the Lord will become his anchor as the storm of adversity crashes down on him.  We not only need some midnight visits from the Lord as we deal with the issues of life, but we also need to cherish them; to remember them and draw strength from them.  Then, as the storm\u2019s fury is unleashed on us we can draw from those midnight visitations and be strengthened to perseverance and peace.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We not only need some midnight visits from the Lord as we deal with the issues of life, but we also need to cherish them as well.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Midnight visitations Acts 23: That night the Master appeared to Paul: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d Paul, the former pursuer and persecutor of Christians is now himself, a Christian who is pursued and persecuted.
