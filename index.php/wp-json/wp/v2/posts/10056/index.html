These folks have little upon which to build. If he starts off dealing with the deeper things of God (like he does in his letter to the church at Rome) they\u2019ll get nothing out of it and will likely turn back to their former way of life. Paul wisely sticks to the basics: Jesus died for our sins and is resurrected. This message speaks to their hearts and they give their lives to the Jesus they hear about from Paul. Still, there\u2019s much more to learn about the Christian life. Now, though, they\u2019re better prepared to learn of the things of God. The reason for this is that now the Holy Spirit is working in their lives. The Spirit, you see, isn\u2019t into keeping secrets. Rather, he\u2019s all about teaching us, leading us one step at a time into a better understanding of the things of God. To some extent we all start our spiritual journey by taking baby steps. It\u2019s important that we, God\u2019s people, remember that in dealing with those who haven\u2019t a clue. There\u2019s no need to argue the finer points of our faith with people who don\u2019t yet have a handle on who Jesus is and what he\u2019s done for us. We start our religious talk here: \u201cLet me tell you about Jesus.\u201d Once a person receives Jesus into their life, the Holy Spirit begins to commune with their spirit, helping them begin to grasp the deeper things of God.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We need to start with the basics in dealing with people, and then trust the Holy Spirit to move them along at the pace he knows is right for them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Starting at the start 1Corinthians 2: God\u2019s Spirit and our spirits in open communion.
