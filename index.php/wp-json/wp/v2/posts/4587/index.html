In his desperation David tells a lie to Ahitub, the priest there, telling him he\u2019s on a mission for the king. He asks for provisions and a weapon. Since David is highly respected the priest gives him holy bread to eat and the prized sword of Goliath that is stored there. As David is leaving he sees one of Saul&#8217;s men, Doeg the Edomite, who&#8217;s also at Nob and has seen what&#8217;s happened. However, David&#8217;s so afraid for his own life that he hurries on, escaping from Saul. Now we see the consequences of David&#8217;s dishonesty and failure to consider the danger in which he placed Ahitub and all those in Nob. Saul&#8217;s man, Doeg, reports the incident and Saul takes revenge on all those at Nob: men, women, children, and even the livestock. All are killed except the son of the priest, Ahimelech, who escapes to join David. When he hears what\u2019s happened David says, &#8220;I&#8217;m to blame.&#8221; This is more than a gracious admission; it\u2019s the terrible truth. In his fear David thought only of himself and in doing so, brought destruction to many innocent people. Fear is an awful thing. It causes us to shrink our world to only ourselves. Fear loses sight of God and causes us to ignore the consequences of our words and deeds. David&#8217;s admission and his taking Ahimelech in and under his protection is commendable, but it doesn&#8217;t undo the damage that was done in his fear-generated failure.<br \/>\nTake Away: Trust is the remedy for fear.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fear-generated failure 1 Samuel 22: I&#8217;m to blame for the death of everyone in your father&#8217;s family.
