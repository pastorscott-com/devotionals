Through the generations he\u2019s done some awesome things, so it isn&#8217;t as though he\u2019s been unseen or absent.  Still, if a person wants a god who\u2019ll perform on demand and can be manipulated by some magic incantation, well, to them, the Lord God might seem to be out of the picture.  However, just because the Almighty won&#8217;t let them call the shots doesn&#8217;t mean he doesn&#8217;t know what\u2019s going on.  Even as they practice their secret sex-oriented religion he\u2019s been watching, and he isn&#8217;t amused by it all.  Every detail of their absurd, twisted efforts at religion is going to be brought to light as God assumes the role of both Judge and Prosecutor. On that day they can call on their wooden and stone gods all they want. There\u2019ll be no answer because there\u2019s nothing there that can answer. Thankfully, part of this message has nothing to do with me. I\u2019ve no secret religion and no idols are hidden away in the closet. However, it\u2019s to my benefit to take hold of the other point here. Just because God isn\u2019t doing what I think he ought to be doing about some situation and just because he\u2019s silent about some issue in my life doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s distant or unconcerned. At times like that I simply have to conclude that God is God and that he\u2019s operating at a level beyond my grasp. I may not always like it, but I don\u2019t have to. I do, though, have to keep on trusting him. That\u2019s part of being one of his people.<br \/>\nTake Away: I don\u2019t have to always understand but I do have to always trust.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trusting when God is silent Isaiah 57: Because I don&#8217;t yell and make a scene do you think I don&#8217;t exist?
