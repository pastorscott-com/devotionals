He still loves us, in bad times as well as good!<br \/>\nA ray of sunshine in a dark place<br \/>\nNaomi and Ruth are destitute and alone as they return to Israel. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. They are two widows on their own. Ruth goes out to the fields hoping to find enough left over from the harvest to give her and Naomi something to eat. To her surprise, she finds herself talking to a wealthy landowner who welcomes her and treats her kindly. Upon returning home she tells Naomi of her adventure. It\u2019s then that Naomi makes this wonderful statement concerning God&#8217;s grace. &#8220;God hasn&#8217;t quite walked out on us after all!&#8221; It seemed that way. Naomi has buried a husband and two sons. In Ruth&#8217;s surprisingly good day of gleaning, and especially in her encounter with Boaz, she sees God at work. &#8220;He still loves us, in bad times as well as good!&#8221; That, my friend, is pretty good theology from a widow woman living in the dark days of the book of Judges. I\u2019m reminded today that my circumstances aren\u2019t an indicator of God&#8217;s work, or lack thereof, in my life. Just because things get hard it doesn&#8217;t mean that God has stopped loving me. Naomi is wise enough to recognize this truth, and I need to realize it too.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even in the hard days the Lord, sometimes unseen, is at work bringing good to our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ruth 2: God hasn&#8217;t quite walked out on us after all!
