While it\u2019s clear that our meeting houses are a far cry from the Temple in everything from architecture to national significance to actual worship practices there\u2019s still the &#8220;House of Worship&#8221; connection. The Temple is where they worship and our churches are where we worship. In fact, the issue at hand presents a pretty strong connection between Temple and church. The people of Nehemiah&#8217;s day pledge themselves to proper support of their Temple. They\u2019ll see to it that every resource necessary for its operation is provided. Today, I thank God for those who support the church like that. Because of their faithfulness the energy of the church can focus on doing the ministry it\u2019s called to do rather than on endless fundraising that the bills might be paid and the maintenance might be done.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for faithful supporters of his work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Building Fund Nehemiah 10: We will not neglect The Temple of our God.
