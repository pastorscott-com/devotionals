I love the request for a &#8220;peaceful and whole life.&#8221;  When all is said and done, this is about as insightful a request as a person can make for their own life.  Isaiah lives in turbulent times and, in the face of so much uncertainty, this prayer makes a lot of sense.  However, he isn&#8217;t the only one who has lived in such days.  We do too.  Again, I like this simple prayer.  The second half of this sentence though, is the reason the person praying thinks the first half will be granted.  Isaiah says, &#8220;We\u2019re following your directions Lord, only doing what you\u2019d have us do, operating under your power and authority.&#8221;  You see, it makes no sense to plead with the Lord for peace and life if I\u2019m ignoring his intentions for my life.  The only way this prayer makes sense is when I pray it in the context of absolute obedience and trust.  It\u2019s only when I can say, &#8220;Everything I have done and am doing is what God is doing in me&#8221; that I can pray with an expectation of God&#8217;s blessing on my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord\u2019s blessings often depend on my obedience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reason to expect an answer to prayer Isaiah 26: God, order a peaceful and whole life for us because everything we&#8217;ve done, you&#8217;ve done for us.
