As he proclaims God&#8217;s message there are others with a very different message, contradicting Jeremiah all the way.  Jeremiah preaches saying, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s message,&#8221; and these other preachers come along right behind him saying, &#8220;No, THIS is God&#8217;s message.&#8221;  These preachers with their alternate sermons have gotten the attention of the people.  They&#8217;ve also gotten the attention of God.  The Lord tells them, &#8220;Only the person I authorize speaks for me.&#8221;  He says he doesn&#8217;t want to hear any more &#8220;God told me&#8221; preaching from the others.  The Lord isn&#8217;t against them discussing Jeremiah&#8217;s sermons.  He says, &#8220;Ask questions of one another, such as &#8216;how do we understand God in this?'&#8221;  I&#8217;ve been in some discussions with people who played what I&#8217;ve heard called the &#8220;God card.&#8221;  That is, they declared that &#8220;God told them&#8221; what was right.  Once that\u2019s said it&#8217;s pretty much the end of the discussion.  After all, who wants to argue with God?  This can be a big problem when someone with a differing view plays their &#8220;God card&#8221; too.  Now what are we going to do?  God is giving conflicting messages to different people!  In this passage I&#8217;m reminded that the Lord\u2019s paying attention to my words.  I&#8217;d better tread lightly when I presume to speak for him.  I&#8217;m not saying the Lord never directs, after all, this is all about Jeremiah&#8217;s message, and he HAD heard directly from God.  Most of the time I&#8217;d better do more listening than &#8220;declaring.&#8221;   The Lord isn&#8217;t opposed to them discussing Jeremiah&#8217;s messages, but he\u2019s very much against them presuming to speak in his name.<br \/>\nTake Away: Most of the time it\u2019s better to \u201clisten\u201d than it is to \u201cdeclare.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Playing the \u201cGod card\u201d Jeremiah 23: Quit the &#8220;God told me this, God told me that&#8221; kind of talk.
