This young man picks up where his father left off: doing the right thing and honoring God. Because of that, he goes down in history as one of the good kings of Judah. This man rules for 29 years and, over all, does what is pleasing in God&#8217;s sight. Still, I can&#8217;t get past the statement that &#8220;he didn&#8217;t come up to the standards of David.&#8221; In other words, Amaziah does &#8220;okay&#8221; and receives a passing grade from the Lord, yet he could have been much more. You might say that David earns an &#8220;A&#8221; while Amaziah earns a &#8220;C+.&#8221; It\u2019s too bad when a person has great potential yet, while things aren&#8217;t a complete disaster, never quite measures up. Do you know what really bothers me here? I\u2019m not as concerned about Amaziah&#8217;s lukewarm reviews as I am of my own! Can it be said of me, &#8220;Well, he did the right thing, but he never measured up to his full potential.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to live a lukewarm life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Oh Lord, set me on fire for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A chip off the old block, almost 2Kings 14: He lived the way God wanted and did the right thing.
