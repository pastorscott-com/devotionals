His sermons are rough and tumble, filled with condemnation.  They&#8217;re also specific: Amos names names.  Now, he\u2019s gotten the attention of some people who they don\u2019t like what they\u2019re hearing.  In fact, they see his warning that a pagan army will \u201cmake hash of you\u201d to be a threat to national security.  One of the important priests, Amaziah, sends word to king Jeroboam that there\u2019s a traitor in their midst who&#8217;s sowing seeds of fear.  Amaziah then confronts Amos.  He wants this farmer to go back to where he came from and do his preaching in that backwater place.  The context of this confrontation is that Amaziah thinks Amos is just in it for the money and notoriety he\u2019s getting and that he\u2019s come to Bethel with his preaching show for more of the same.  Amos stands up to the powerful priest and declares that he had no desire to preach in the first place.  Unlike Amaziah, Amos has no family tree of ancestors who are clergy.  He\u2019s a mere farmer who&#8217;s heard from God and has been told to proclaim God\u2019s message.  To this day the Lord is still sending people into the ministry.  Some of us heard that call while we were still young children.  Others battled with it as teens, and still others, like Amos, were established in their lives and, in response to the call embarked on a whole new career.  Amos is a poster child for all who are called by God, but he\u2019s especially an example of how God sometimes calls adults who must walk away from one life and obey God in another.<br \/>\nTake Away: To this day the Lord is still sending people into the ministry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s call Amos 7: I never set up to be a preacher, never had plans to be a preacher.
