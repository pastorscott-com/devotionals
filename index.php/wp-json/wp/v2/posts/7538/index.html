In spite of the fact that his father&#8217;s story is well known Belshazzar chooses stupid arrogance and practically dares the God his father came to honor to do anything to stop him.  So, God Almighty takes up his dare.  Even as Belshazzar uses the items taken from the Temple as tableware for a drunken party the hand of God miraculously   appears to write the three words of condemnation.  As Daniel explains to him, &#8220;God has numbered your life and it just doesn&#8217;t add up!  He&#8217;s weighed the value of your life and it doesn&#8217;t make weight.  He&#8217;s decided to divide your kingdom and give it to others.&#8221;  This unworthy man&#8217;s life is about to end in an unworthy way.  It&#8217;s pitiful isn&#8217;t it!  Nebuchadnezzar did all the heavy lifting for his son.  Not only did he hand over to him the most powerful kingdom on earth, but Nebuchadnezzar went through the years of out-of-his-mind torment to get his head screwed on straight about the God of the Hebrews.  All Belshazzar has to do was pick up where his father left off.  Instead he delivers stupidity.  The Lord expects him to gain from his father&#8217;s experience. When he doesn&#8217;t do it, it&#8217;s &#8220;Mene, Teqel, Peres&#8221; and a brief appearance on the world stage before going down in flames.<br \/>\nTake Away: While parents have the responsibility of passing on their faith to their children, children have the responsibility of taking up that faith and making it their own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Handwriting on the wall Daniel 5: Mene, Teqel, Peres.
