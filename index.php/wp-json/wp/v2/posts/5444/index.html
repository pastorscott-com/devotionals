The Promised One&#8217;s coming will impact lives as nothing else could.  The broken relationship that exists between the Creator and the Creation will be repaired as God comes to us in the Messiah.  The greatest need of humanity is that this broken relationship be repaired.  Everything that\u2019s messed up about us is messed up because we\u2019ve become disconnected from the Source of Life.  The solution isn\u2019t that we try harder, or figure out how to fix things, or somehow appease the Lord.  While being forgiven of our sins and receiving the promise of heaven is a part of God&#8217;s intention for us, it\u2019s only a part.  We\u2019re created to live in fellowship with God and that fellowship is broken.  We broke it and in so doing, broke ourselves.  Only he can provide a solution to this problem. When I receive this &#8220;Re-connecter&#8221; into my heart, cooperate with him day by day, and let him do his work in my life his mission is being completed in me.<br \/>\nTake Away: We\u2019re created to live in fellowship with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being reconnected to God Isaiah 49: I form you and use you to reconnect the people with me.
