Along the way he gets mad and kills thirty men for their clothing to use in paying a lost bet. He gets married, but when he\u2019s absent for a while, her father gives his bride to the fellow who was best man at the wedding. Once again, Samson gets mad and burns their fields. The Philistines retaliate by killing his bride and her father. True to form, Samson swears to get even. Isn\u2019t this a pleasant story (not!)? Interestingly enough, we\u2019re told at the beginning of this story that \u201cGod was behind this.\u201d What\u2019s going on here? How can God be involved in feuds and retaliation and the like? I think I know the answer. Samson is one of the most selfish and self-absorbed people in the Bible. Apparently, his parents are so impressed that the birth of their son was announced by an angel and since he came with special \u201chandling instructions\u201d they have never said \u201cno\u201d to him in his life. The Lord knows that Samson will never consider taking on the Philistines for the good of his people. All he\u2019s interested in is Samson. Therefore, there has to be something in this for Samson and a great motivator in his life is revenge. It\u2019s strange, I know, but it seems God accomplishes his purposes by manipulating Samson into doing what the Lord wants him to do in the first place. Had Samson been a man with some moral integrity the account of his life would be quite different. Still, the Almighty has his way with Samson even though the byword of his life is \u201crevenge.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: Better to cooperate with the Lord in doing what he wants done, but, ultimately, God\u2019s purposes will be accomplished either way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not exactly the Sermon on the Mount Judges 15: I swear I\u2019ll get even with you.
