Don\u2019t climb the mountain.<br \/>\nOf all the appearances of God on earth in the Bible the coming of the Almighty to Mount Sinai is the most impressive.  Earlier, the Lord appeared to Moses in a burning bush.  Now he appears to Israel in a burning mountain.  There are thick clouds, thunder, earthquakes, and the sound of trumpet blasts.  The people are warned to keep their distance or die.  As I read this event I find myself wondering why God came in such a dramatic way.  Centuries earlier, he came to the first man and woman for a quiet conversation in the cool of the day.  Later on he wrestled with Jacob through the night.  However, here at Sinai the appearance of the Lord is the most dramatic event to have ever happened on the face of the earth.  I think the Lord\u2019s making the point that he&#8217;s not a God to be trifled with.  If he\u2019s to make Israel into his own people they must grasp something of his holiness.  They need to see him as more than a God who gives them free food each morning and who helps them win battles.  Instead, they need to see the awful power of his holiness.   This is a God to serve, to reverence, and to obey.  Before Moses ever begins his unforgettable encounter with the Divine there are lessons to be learned.  We Christians focus on an entirely different view of God.  We see him as a meek Carpenter who loves us even to a cross.  That, of course, is a correct view of the Lord.  However, there\u2019s more to him than that.  Each of us must spend some reverent and fearful time at Sinai if we\u2019re to begin understanding who God is.<br \/>\nTake Away: Mt. Sinai is a good place to take some \u201creverence lessons.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The frightening side of God Exodus 19: Warning! Don\u2019t climb the mountain.
