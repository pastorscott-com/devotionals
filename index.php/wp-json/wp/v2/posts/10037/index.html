The attempt to move the ship just a few miles to a better winter harbor results in disaster as a huge storm sweeps in, driving the ship out to sea.  The sailors do all they can to save themselves and their passengers but it appears that their worst nightmare has come upon them and that all 276 on board will be lost.  Then Paul reports that for a short time overnight there was not, 276 passengers, but 277 on board.  The Lord sent an angel to encourage Paul and give him a message for the entire ship\u2019s company.  The ship will, indeed, be lost, but everyone will survive without a scratch.  Soon, it\u2019s \u201cland-ho\u201d as an island is spotted.  The ship strikes a reef and is being torn apart and the order is given to \u201cabandon ship.\u201d  Swimmers dive in and the land lubbers find bits and pieces of the ship and float to shore.  As a person who isn\u2019t much of a swimmer I can identify with those \u201cplank grabbers.\u201d  No doubt, I would have been one of them.  Spiritually speaking, we\u2019re all, to some extent headed for shipwreck.  After all, no one\u2019s going to get out of this world alive.  The only hope I have of surviving this shipwreck is to hold on to some wood that will get me to shore.  That wood just happens to be in the shape of a cross.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I\u2019m holding on to that cross for \u201cdear life.\u201d<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grab a plank and hang on for dear life Acts 27: He gave orders for anyone who could swim to dive in and go for it, and for the rest to grab a plank.
