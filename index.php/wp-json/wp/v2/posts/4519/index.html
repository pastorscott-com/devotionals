Someone needs to be responsible for the Ark. After all, during the seven years that it was in the hands of the Philistines tumors broke out among the population and when the men of Beth Shemesh treated it in an irreverent way they were struck dead. They can&#8217;t have the Ark just sitting around. Someone has to care for it. Abinadab&#8217;s son, Eleazar, takes the job. For the next twenty years Eleazar takes care of the Chest of God. We know nothing else about him. Not a single word from him is recorded in Scripture and he\u2019s associated with none of the adventures of the Bible. He just takes care of the Ark. During that time a spiritual change for the better is taking place. Samuel is growing too &#8212; in spirit and in body. Soon, this spiritual giant will take center stage and will be the spiritual leader of Israel for decades to come. But, for now, God just needs someone to look after the Ark; to be a &#8220;place holder&#8221; for Samuel until he\u2019s ready to assume leadership. Not many of us are &#8220;Samuels.&#8221; No doubt, God calls some to do the big stuff, and I thank God for them. Most of us are called to simply be faithful, serving the Lord every day, doing what he\u2019s placed before us. It\u2019s nice to be reminded though, that in this small way Eleazar kept things going for the good. His faithfulness held things together while God prepared the &#8220;big player&#8221; to come on the scene. I think that is pretty impressive.<br \/>\nTake Away: What an honor it is to be used of the Lord, even in some small, unnoticed way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not famous, but faithful 1 Samuel 7 They ordained his son, Eleazar, to take responsibility for the Chest of God.
