I\u2019ve been helped with this discomfort, at least a bit, by the realization that it\u2019s the Church as a whole that\u2019s described as the bride of Christ, not followers of Jesus as individuals. We aren\u2019t all \u201cbrides of Christ.\u201d Together we\u2019re \u201cthe bride of Christ.\u201d Obviously, there\u2019s no sexual component here anyway. Here in the latter part of his vision, John sees Jesus riding on a white horse finishing up the judgment of God upon the earth and preparing for the great celebration that&#8217;s about to come. His people, the Church, have stood faithful to him and now he&#8217;ll be united with them forever. The big feast that has been in the making for all these years is about to take place. Christ is about to claim his Church as a King who comes to claim his throne to the cheers of his loyal subjects. When I think about it this way, I\u2019m reminded that there\u2019s nothing \u201csissy\u201d about it at all.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s the Church that\u2019s the bride of Christ and every believer is a part of that great number.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The King is coming Revelation 19: Blessed are those invited to the wedding Supper of the Lamb.
