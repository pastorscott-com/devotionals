They have pretty much stood still through the plagues and God took care of everything.  Surely Moses is right and God will do it again.  But God has other ideas.  Even as the people of Israel had a part in the Passover by following God\u2019s directions, now they have a part in this final victory over Egypt.  The Almighty says, \u201cDon\u2019t stand still\u2026move forward.\u201d  As they obey the command to move, God acts and deliverance comes.  There are, indeed, times to \u201cstand still.\u201d  To do otherwise is to attempt to be our own deliverers \u2013 something that\u2019s bound to fail.  At times like that we simply wait on the Lord.
