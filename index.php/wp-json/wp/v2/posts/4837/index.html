King Nebuchadnezzar personally oversees the final defeat of Jerusalem and then orders its total destruction. Anything of value is carried off and the rest is leveled. Even the Temple is destroyed as the city is left desolate, uninhabitable. For this generation it\u2019s all over. Those who survive will live their lives as exiles, with all the wonderful promises of the now-broken Covenant discarded in the pile of rubble that was Jerusalem. History tells us the human reasons for all this: the rise of Babylon, the defeat of Egypt and Assyria, and the physical location of Judah. However, the Bible tells us the spiritual reason: sin. They rejected God and then, after centuries of patience and renewed chances, God rejected them. It isn&#8217;t easy, but it is possible to exhaust the patience of a merciful God. This ought to serve as a warning to both individuals and nations.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for his mercy and patience\u2026yes, thank him, but take advantage of them too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The end 2Kings 25: Judah went into exile, orphaned from her land.
