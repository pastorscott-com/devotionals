However, when I see the Lord getting angry in the face of all his objections I realize that humble or not, Moses is treading on thin ice with the Almighty.  The Lord is appearing to Moses in a burning bush with the promise that, in spite of the king\u2019s opposition that Moses will lead the people out of Egypt.  Moses wants the Lord to give him a Name to use when he goes to the Hebrews and the King.  The Lord obliges.  Moses wants some kind of sign that will convince Pharaoh that it\u2019s the Almighty he\u2019s dealing with.  The Lord gives him not one sign but three.  Then Moses adds that he doesn\u2019t want to actually do any of the talking and wants the Lord to name a spokesperson other than himself.  At that point, he\u2019s nearly found the end of God\u2019s patience.  The Lord promises Moses that he\u2019ll give him the words to say and everything will be okay.  When Moses persists in wanting someone else to do his talking for him, he nearly blows the whole deal with God.  However, the Lord is merciful and tells Moses he\u2019ll use his brother, Aaron, as spokesman.  This, my friend, is a lesson in how not to deal with God.  It\u2019s not that exchanges with the Lord shouldn\u2019t be open and honest.  However, they should also be reverent and trusting.  The best answer to God is just two words, \u201cYes, Lord.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: The only reasonable response to the Almighty is: \u201cyes.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The best thing to say to God Exodus 4: God got angry with Moses.
