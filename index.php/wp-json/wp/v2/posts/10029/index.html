They\u2019ve repented of their sins and been baptized with water, believing in the One John the Baptist preached about.  When Paul arrives in Ephesus and makes inquiries as to whether there are any followers of The Way in Ephesus, someone tells him about them.  They welcome him with open arms and soon Paul is updating them on what God&#8217;s doing.  As he brings them up to speed he tells them of the awesome events of the Day of Pentecost.  They\u2019re thrilled at the idea of God\u2019s Holy Spirit living in their lives.  It sounds almost too good to be true.  Soon these believers are receivers.  They\u2019re filled with the Spirit.  Years earlier Jesus so values this infilling that he tells the disciples to remain in Jerusalem until they receive the Holy Spirit.  Now, Paul encounters this group of isolated disciples and almost immediately tells them about the Holy Spirit\u2019s infilling.  This work of God is, apparently, a priority in the Book of Acts and, is, therefore, a priority for all God\u2019s people.  Paul\u2019s focus on the status of their relationship with the Holy Spirit is a good focus for all of God\u2019s people.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Have you received the Spirit since you believed?<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Believers becoming receivers Acts 19: We\u2019ve never heard of that \u2013 a Holy Spirit?
