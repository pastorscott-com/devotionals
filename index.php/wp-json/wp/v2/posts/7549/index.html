The first half recounts for us stories of God&#8217;s empowerment of and protection over the Hebrews who were taken into Babylon.  The second half contains Daniel&#8217;s reports of his visions and dreams concerning the future.  I think anyone will agree that the stories are more fun than the visions.  However, we find in these six chapters of Daniel Old Testament writing that reminds us of the Book of Revelation.  In fact, it\u2019s likely that the writer of Revelation borrows some of his imagery from these visions.  When Daniel is tossed into the den of lions we read about it as a very personal account of faith and deliverance.  Now, his visions of the flow of history are so broad in scope as to take our breath away.  He sees kingdoms rise and fall as bewildering history unfolds before him.  Theologically, I firmly believe the Lord has granted us free will and, because of that, the future isn\u2019t predetermined in detail.  However, I also believe that God is ushering the human race to a future he&#8217;s already declared.  In other words, I\u2019m free to cooperate with God or not.  Because of that, my future isn\u2019t predestined.  The big picture, though, is known to God because he&#8217;s already determined to bring it to pass.  When the Almighty decides to do something, well, he doesn&#8217;t have to see the future to state that it will happen.  In this specific vision, Daniel sees a series of future kingdoms appear, flourish, and then give way to the next.  At one point he notes that in the midst of all the rising and falling that there&#8217;s a fiery throne and on that throne sits the Ancient of Days.  I love that picture.  Kingdoms rise and fall, human history marches through time, and in the midst of it all we see God in his glory and authority.  I don&#8217;t claim to have all that great a handle on prophecy but I think I have this one figured out.  Through it all, in it all, above it all: God is.<br \/>\nTake Away: Everything else gives way.  God remains.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The bottom line on the bottom line Daniel 7: The Old One sat down. The Book of Daniel is clearly divided into two parts.
