Jacob is related to Laban both through his mother and by marriage. He and Laban have a strange relationship. Laban has lied to Jacob and cheated him. However, every dirty trick Laban tries backfires and Jacob comes out ahead every time. Laban hasn\u2019t really lost anything because the overflow of Jacob\u2019s blessings has spilled over onto him. Finally, Jacob has had enough. He, who arrived at Laban\u2019s doorstep with nothing, is now leaving as a man who&#8217;s rich in family and belongings. Given the relationship between these two men, it\u2019s no surprise that Jacob attempts to leave in secret. However, this is no small relocation and Laban and his men easily catch up to Jacob\u2019s huge entourage. The two men have it out; Jacob complaining about how Laban constantly changed the rules and Laban about how everything Jacob has is his. This, apparently, clears the air. Neither man admits to any wrong doing but Laban suggests a truce between them. Out in the wilderness they make a covenant of peace. From now on they&#8217;ll do one another no harm. To commemorate the occasion they build a monument called \u201cGaleed\u201d or \u201cWitness Monument\u201d and part on good terms. They call upon the Lord to hold them to their new covenant. From now on they will treat one another with respect. Sometimes it\u2019s a good idea to let the past go and get a new start with those with whom we\u2019ve had issues.<br \/>\nTake away: Is there someone with whom I need to make a fresh start?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Covenant of peace Genesis 31: So let\u2019s settle things between us, make a covenant.
