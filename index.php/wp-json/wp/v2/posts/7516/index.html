There are so many nice places to eat, we&#8217;re out of our routine, and there&#8217;s the strange notion that &#8220;what happens on vacation stays on vacation.&#8221;  One &#8220;off diet&#8221; meal leads to another and I end up bringing home, not just pleasant memories and photos of all the places we saw, but a few extra pounds too.  Of course, Daniel and his companions aren&#8217;t on vacation.  They&#8217;ve been taken against their will to a distant land with little hope of returning home.  Even if they could go back, things are very different than when they left.  Still, they&#8217;re in very pleasant surroundings.  They&#8217;re part of the household of the most powerful king on earth and they&#8217;re being groomed to serve in the royal court.  Their rations aren\u2019t bread and water but, instead, are the richest of foods and the finest of wines.  The thing is that their religion has strict dietary rules.  That pork chop might look quite tasty, but it&#8217;s forbidden to them by their God.  If we struggle with our diets just because we\u2019re a few hundred miles from home, think of their struggle.  The Temple, Jerusalem, and their family ties are all in their past.  Do the rules even apply anymore?  If they do just go along with what is being asked of them where will it take them next?  Does saying &#8220;yes&#8221; here mean they&#8217;ll be expected to say &#8220;yes&#8221; somewhere else, like, for instance, the worship of an idol?  Daniel decides to draw the line right where he is.  He&#8217;s a follower of God and God has given him some dietary rules.  He&#8217;ll be respectful, but he&#8217;ll hold steady at this minor point.  If he never starts down the path away from God he&#8217;ll never end up where that path leads.  I don&#8217;t know if this passage will help me stay on my diet or not, but it certainly can help me remember that spiritual failure doesn&#8217;t start with my rejecting God in some big way.  Rather, it starts with little things.  If I win there, I&#8217;m much more likely to conquer the &#8220;biggie&#8221; when it shows up.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we never start down the path away from God we&#8217;ll never end up where that path leads.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winning in little ways first Daniel 1: Daniel determined that he would not defile himself by eating the king&#8217;s food.
