In fact, the gods of Egypt seem to have the upper hand. After all, they\u2019re slaves and the Egyptians are their masters. Moses asks the God of Abraham \u201cWhen I tell my fellow Hebrews about you, who do I say is acting on their behalf?\u201d The answer has become a source of discussion for students of theology for thousands of years now. God says, \u201cJust tell them \u2018I AM WHO I AM\u2019 sent you.\u201d So what\u2019s the meaning of this name? My first response is that God is saying, \u201cI am the One who always exists \u2013 who simply \u2018IS.\u2019\u201d However, some suggest that the answer is more along the lines of, \u201cThey will know WHO I AM by WHAT I DO.\u201d They say that the answer isn\u2019t about time. Rather, it\u2019s about action. I firmly believe \u201cGOD IS\u201d but I also know \u201cGOD DOES.\u201d It\u2019s God-in-action who is the star in this story.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Bible is all about God, WHO he is and WHAT he does.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May I ask who is calling?
