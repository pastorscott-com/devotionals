They\u2019re living apart from the God who gave them life. Their nation is under considerable threat and they\u2019re looking for help from everywhere but from the Lord. Things look hopeless and, if they continue as they are, that is just the way it is. Still, through Isaiah, the Almighty reaches out to them. Isaiah says &#8220;He&#8217;s waiting around to be gracious to you.&#8221; This is as powerful a vision of God&#8217;s grace as you&#8217;ll ever find apart from the cross. If the Lord is waiting for me to mess up so he can &#8220;get me&#8221; the wait would be long over. Instead, I see here a picture of God Almighty patiently waiting for me to look his way. When I do that, he doesn&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;ve been bad and that I deserve what I\u2019m about to get. Rather, he tells me he loves me and wants to transform my life in wonderful ways. The only thing that stands between me and the grace of God is, well, me! When I bring my messed up life to him he begins to pour grace out: bucketfuls of it! How about you? Have you been afraid to come to God because you think he\u2019s just waiting to send you to hell? If so, this passage contains some of the best news you&#8217;ll ever find. When you turn to the Lord you find an ocean sized portion of grace just for you.<br \/>\nTake Away: The only thing standing between you and grace is you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grace as far as the eye can see Isaiah 30: Cry for help and you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s grace and more grace.
