Which should receive the greatest response?  It\u2019s a no-brainer, right?   Not for Jonah.  He retreats a safe distance from Nineveh to watch the fireworks of its destruction.  When the Lord provides a miraculous shade plant for him it calms him down and he feels good about things for the first time in days.  Then, overnight, the plant&#8217;s dead and Jonah\u2019s mood dies with it.  At this point the Lord decides it\u2019s time for this pitiful man to change his attitude.  If the short life cycle of a shade plant can cause Jonah to go through such a mood swing doesn\u2019t it make sense that the Almighty change his thinking about a city full of repentant people?   Of course it does.  Like Jonah, I tend to get all wound up about stuff that isn\u2019t worth a hill of beans: getting my own way in some unimportant thing, or the World Series, or buying some new gadget.  If my team wins, I\u2019m in a good mood and if they don\u2019t&#8230;well, I\u2019m not a happy camper.  Meanwhile, God is focused on people.  He\u2019s already judged sin, and he very much wants people to let him change their lives so he can change their eternity.  I really need to get on the same page as God.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is focused on people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Attitude adjustment Jonah 4: Why can\u2019t I likewise change what I feel about Nineveh?
