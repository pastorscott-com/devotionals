Joshua represents not only himself, or the priesthood of Israel, but the entire nation.  Their situation is a dire one.  Even though they&#8217;ve been snatched from the consequences of their sin and returned to their homeland, they remain unclean before God.  And that\u2019s what the Accuser comes to declare.  However, there&#8217;s a remedy.  In the vision, the Lord removes the high priest\u2019s uncleanness and outfits him in clean clothes.  Then, the prophet asks that Joshua be given a clean turban as well.  Now, remember that Joshua&#8217;s the high priest.  The clothes he&#8217;s given aren\u2019t just average clothes and the turban isn\u2019t an average turban.  They&#8217;re the robes and turban of the high priest: rich garments reflecting his high position.  That hat, in particular, has meaning.  The turban worn by the high priest has a gold plate on it that\u2019s inscribed with the words \u201cHoliness unto the Lord.\u201d  This is powerful symbolism.  Although the people are redeemed they remain unclean in the sight of the Lord.  Through the mercy and grace of God there\u2019s a remedy.  The Lord purifies their lives and then outfits them in his holiness.  Believers of today can identify with this.  After I put my faith in Jesus as my Savior I come to realize that there remains a basic uncleanness in my heart.  It\u2019s when I throw himself to the mercy of God that he takes action to graciously purify my heart and fill me with his Holy Spirit that I might be holy in his sight.<br \/>\nTake Away: Through the mercy and grace of the Lord there\u2019s a remedy for the stain of sin.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A courtroom scene Zechariah 3: Get him out of those filthy clothes.
