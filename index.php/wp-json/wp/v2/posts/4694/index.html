How we need God&#8217;s help in this! There are so many voices calling to us, so many distractions, so many opportunities to turn our hearts from God. If I\u2019m not careful the Lord is pushed from the center of my life to some secondary role. Many things lay claim to &#8220;first&#8221; in my life. Some of those things are worthy in and of themselves: family, health, relationships. Others are merely pretenders: comfort, entertainment, security. The thing is that when my life is centered on God everything else tends to land in its proper place. That includes both those things that are pretty important and those that only seem to be important. My prayer for myself today is Solomon&#8217;s prayer for his people, &#8220;May he keep me centered and devoted to him.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord is at the center of our lives, the throne of our hearts, everything else tends to fall into their proper places.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Centered on God 1Kings 8: May he keep us centered and devoted to him.
