His uncle, Laban, it seems, has some \u201cuse others as a stepping stone\u201d tendencies himself. First, after Jacob has served him for seven years he\u2019s tricked into marrying the wrong daughter! He ends up with both of Laban\u2019s daughters as wives in a tension-filled household. The sisters even involve their maids in a sort of pitiful \u201cmake babies\u201d contest. Laban then makes a deal with Jacob to work in exchange for livestock. The deal turns into a sweet one for Jacob so Laban just changes the contract \u2013 not once, but repeatedly. Meanwhile, God\u2019s at work. When Jacob is treated unfairly God gives him a plan that will keep things fair. It\u2019s at this point that Jacob, thinking of Laban\u2019s changing rules, says \u201cGod hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 he said he would stand by me and he has.\u201d Jacob hasn\u2019t yet arrived but he\u2019s a work in progress. The Lord\u2019s using the experiences of his life to teach Jacob about his faithfulness. The lesson Jacob is learning is the same one I\u2019m learning. It isn\u2019t that I\u2019m always fairly treated or that things always go as I think they should. The steadying factor in my life is that God never changes and is ever faithful to me.<br \/>\nTake away: Life is often unfair and uncertain but God is always faithful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A work in progress Genesis 31: But the God of my father hasn\u2019t changed, he\u2019s still with me.
