Now, it\u2019s not just faith in faith. The focus of this powerful faith is clearly identified as \u201ctrust in God.\u201d If I place my faith elsewhere, no matter now sincere that faith might be; it will be an act of foolishness that will take me down the path of disappointment and maybe even destruction. The heroes of faith described in this passage didn\u2019t believe in belief. Rather they believed in, and trusted in, God. These people weren\u2019t disappointed as the Lord came through for them in wonderful ways. The writer takes us on a faith tour, stopping before each exhibit just long enough to remind us of their victorious stories. Before we\u2019re ready, he tells us time is up and we get just a glance down the hall of \u201ccurrent events\u201d where we see people making great sacrifices for their faith, believing whatever it is they\u2019re facing is worth the reward they&#8217;re earning. As we prepare to move on, our host says something quite surprising. As wonderful as their examples of faith is, it\u2019s incomplete. We\u2019re not on this tour just to look back. Rather, we\u2019re here to be inspired to join in; to add our stories to theirs. Their looking-forward-to-God\u2019s-better-plan-faith is to be balanced and completed by our embracing-the-better-plan-that\u2019s-now-available-faith. As we live in this new salvation plan we prove the validity of their faith years ago. They carried the torch of faith as far as they could; now it\u2019s been passed on to us. What an honor, what a privilege, and what a responsibility is ours.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We don\u2019t just remember great faith of years gone by \u2013 we embrace it and advance it to our day and age.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Continuing the story Hebrews 11: Their faith and our faith would come together to make one completed whole.
