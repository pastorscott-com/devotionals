Now, years later we find Paul, along with his friend and mentor Barnabas working among the Gentile believers in Antioch.  It\u2019s reasonable to assume that Paul thinks he\u2019s fulfilling that calling, living distant from Jerusalem, ministering across cultural lines.  Then there\u2019s an unexpected stirring in his heart.  The Lord is moving him in a new, and somewhat unexpected, direction.  Soon the church leaders receive word from the Holy Spirit on this matter.  Paul and Barnabas are to be set apart to take the gospel into new territory.  The move a few years earlier to Antioch may have felt as though it was the ultimate response to God\u2019s call but now Paul sees that it was but a step in the direction the Lord had for him.  The rest of his life will be lived \u201cout there\u201d proclaiming the gospel in new places, doing just what the Lord said years earlier in Damascus.  To some extent we\u2019re always on a journey.  Even when we stay in the same place the circumstances around us change.  However, at times the Lord tells us that what we took for a permanent assignment was merely a stepping stone to the next thing.  Just because the Lord puts me in a place for a time or blesses me in a particular way as I do things in some specific manner doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m to institutionalize it and refuse to budge from there.  I must not confuse a step for a permanent assignment.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Don\u2019t get too settled.
