By the time he arrives in Jerusalem the Temple project is complete and worship activities have begun there. This direct descendant of Aaron, the first priest of Israel, is as much historian as he is priest. In spite of his being born in a land far from Jerusalem, he committed himself to the study of God&#8217;s Word. Because of this he\u2019s both a priest and a scholar. It\u2019s this that makes him so valuable to the returned exiles. They have a Temple and now they need a spiritual leader to help them learn how to be a people of God. Ezra is God\u2019s man at God\u2019s time in God\u2019s place. The verse quoted is a preacher&#8217;s dream! There are three obvious points and each provides lots of preaching material. First, Ezra has committed himself to studying God&#8217;s Word. Second, beyond studying it, he personally lives it. Third, he has a burning desire to teach God&#8217;s ways to others. It is when he\u2019s given the opportunity to do the third goal of his life that Ezra travels to Jerusalem to be the leader and teacher of God&#8217;s people there.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for putting the right people in the right places at the right times in history.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s man at God\u2019s time in God\u2019s place Ezra 7: Ezra had committed himself to studying the Revelation of God, to living it, and to teaching Israel to live its truths and ways.
