Oh how the pilgrim looks forward to being in the Temple of God.  He can&#8217;t help but think of how blest are those whose serve in that place day by day.  However, there\u2019s more than even that here.  The song writer finds himself thinking about people who are living their lives in the Lord, journeying with him along the dusty roads and through the lonesome valleys of life.  Not that there aren&#8217;t some blest times along the way because there are some &#8220;cool springs&#8221; that refresh the weary traveler.  Then, there\u2019s one last mountain to climb, one last curve to navigate; and then Zion comes into view.   That &#8220;lonesome valley&#8221; journey is quickly forgotten as beautiful Zion is seen.  What a powerful picture he\u2019s painted.  Today, I thank God for walking with me on my life journey.  I thank him for the blessings of cool springs along the way and for his faithfulness to me even in the lonesome valleys.  For me, and for most of us, the blessings far outnumber the trials.  But whether or not that is true for you in particular we all have this hope: one of these days we\u2019ll climb that last mountain and round the final curve and our Zion will come into view.  As the old gospel song says, &#8220;Heaven will surely be worth it all.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: We are a people with hope; hope both in this world and in the world to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Heaven will surely be worth it all Psalm 84: These roads curve up the mountain, and at the last turn &#8212; Zion!
