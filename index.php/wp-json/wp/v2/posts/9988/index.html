He asks, \u201cWhat shall I do with Jesus?\u201d a question that has inspired many a sermon.  He asks Jesus, \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d  He also muses, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d   He presents the battered and bloody Jesus to the Jews saying, \u201cHere is the man.\u201d  Then, he washes his hands and says, \u201cI am innocent of this man\u2019s blood.\u201d  As Jesus is crucified the Jews complain about what he\u2019s written as his crime.  He responds, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve written, I\u2019ve written.\u201d   Today, as I read of Pilate declaring to the Jews the innocence of Jesus the translator gives me his words as, \u201cHe seems harmless enough to me.\u201d  I understand the meaning of the phrase.  The Jews say Jesus is a dangerous person, influencing people to rebel against Roman rule.  Jesus, of course, never does anything like that.  Pilate&#8217;s investigating this charge and, as far as the Romans are concerned, he concludes that Jesus is a harmless person.  Of course, that characterization is absolutely wrong.  Jesus is dangerous beyond words.  He intends to rule the world.  Rome is, in fact, a mere bump in the road as far as Jesus\u2019 intentions are concerned.  You see, for those who love him and give themselves to him, Jesus is the most wonderful friend they\u2019ll ever have.  To this day, Jesus invites all who will to come to him and find this to be true.  However, a day is coming when this meek Jesus will take his rightful place.  At that time, this \u201charmless\u201d Jesus will be in charge.  At that time, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Far from harmless \u2013 Jesus is Lord God.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wrong!
