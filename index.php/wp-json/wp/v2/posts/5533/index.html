Day after day after day they never give me a thought.<br \/>\nJeremiah says people think about the things that are important to them.  Women don&#8217;t forget that they own beautiful jewelry.  Guys don&#8217;t forget that the NFL playoffs are on.  Political junkies don&#8217;t overlook the New Hampshire primaries.  Jeremiah says that God&#8217;s charge against his people is that they\u2019ve forgotten him.  They live their days without giving God much thought, taking him for granted while focusing on things that really do matter to them.  It isn&#8217;t so much that they&#8217;ve made a decision that God doesn&#8217;t matter.  They&#8217;ve just concentrated on other things and neglected the spiritual.  Now, they can go for days without giving the Lord any thought at all.  I imagine that all that can change in an instant.  When trouble comes they can get all &#8220;spiritual&#8221; in a hurry.  God doesn&#8217;t like being treated that way.  He created us to live in constant fellowship with himself.  Apparently, he takes it personally when I can spend a day immersed in other things without giving him a thought.  With that in mind, I must discipline my mind to keep God on my mind.  Lord, let it never be said of me that I can wander through my day without giving you a thought.<br \/>\nTake Away: I must discipline my mind to keep the Lord on my mind.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Insulting God Jeremiah 2: But my people forget me.
