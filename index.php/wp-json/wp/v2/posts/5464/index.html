However, Isaiah doesn&#8217;t only tell us of the sufferings of the Messiah.  He tells us why it happened.  God planned it.  What happens at Calvary isn\u2019t something that\u2019s &#8220;done to Jesus.&#8221;  Instead, it\u2019s something that Jesus &#8220;does for us.&#8221;  The Lord knew that we\u2019d never just &#8220;get over&#8221; sin.  He knew that the broken relationship between us and him was broken beyond that which could be repaired by some minor patch up job.  There was only one hope of redemption and that hope was that the Son of God, the Suffering Servant, would carry our sins even to the grave.
