We&#8217;re not talking about such a nation getting a slap on the wrist for being &#8220;bad.&#8221;  This is a life and death situation.  The Lord says that when he sees a nation on this road he desperately seeks people who&#8217;ll stand up for what&#8217;s right.  He doesn&#8217;t want to destroy that nation.  Instead, he wants to redeem it and make its people into a people his very own.  With that in mind, he looks everywhere for some key person in some key situation who&#8217;ll declare their loyalty to him and his ways.  In Ezekiel&#8217;s day that person is never found.  I may not be able to influence nations for righteousness, but maybe I can influence someone.  With that in mind I step into the gap to stand for God even as I pray that that \u201cbig player\u201d will step up to stand in the gap for my nation.<br \/>\nTake Away: \u201cHere I am, send me.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Key people Ezekiel 22: I looked for someone to&#8230;stand in the gap to protect this land.
