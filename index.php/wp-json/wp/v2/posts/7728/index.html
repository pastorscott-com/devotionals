The result was repentance and God changing his mind about destroying them.  Nahum isn\u2019t instructed to go to Nineveh but he&#8217;s given a similar message of destruction.  His sermons appear to be directed to Nineveh but his audience is Judah.  One reason for these anti-Nineveh sermons being preached in Judah is that the people of God are more concerned about what Assyria and its capitol Nineveh is doing than they are with trusting the Lord.  They need to be reminded that, even though they see Assyria as a mountain of power that God sees it as just another anthill.  The second reason for this seeming \u201cpreaching to the wrong crowd\u201d is what&#8217;s said in this verse.  In Jonah\u2019s day the Lord hoped to spare Nineveh.  They were great sinners even then, but, according to the Lord, they were more ignorant than rebellious.  Because of that, the Lord was more than willing to change his mind and spare them if they would but turn to him in repentance.  Here in Nahum\u2019s day that has changed.  He preaches about a nation that has pushed God too far and, for them, judgment has come.  Nahum preaches sermons against Nineveh for the sake of Judah.  He doesn\u2019t preach them in Nineveh because it\u2019s too late for them to repent.  I guess the lesson for today is that as long as God speaks to our hearts, even if what he says is guilt producing condemnation, there\u2019s still hope for us.  It\u2019s when we no longer hear from him that it\u2019s too late.  Isaiah put it this way: \u201cSeek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near.\u201d (Isaiah 55:6 )<br \/>\nTake Away: As long as God speaks to our hearts there\u2019s still hope.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why Nahum preaches to the wrong congregation Nahum 3: You\u2019re past the point of no return.
