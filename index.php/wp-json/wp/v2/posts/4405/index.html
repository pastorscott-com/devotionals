It\u2019s God&#8217;s provision for them, meeting their needs in places and under circumstances in which that need could be met in no other way. They eat other things too but it\u2019s manna that\u2019s the staple in their diet. Now they have a toe hold on the land God promised to them.  There\u2019s much to be done: wars to be fought, land to be claimed, but finally they are here.  Apparently, they\u2019ve camped at Gilgal long enough to plant and harvest their first crop of grain.  What a great Passover, remembering not only deliverance from Egypt but also now beginning to receive the land God promised them.  With the harvest of this first Canaan crop the manna stops.  The end of the manna isn&#8217;t an indication that God\u2019s no longer going to provide for them.  It\u2019s simply a change in how he\u2019s going to do it.  Now the Lord\u2019s providing for them in a new (only to them) way.  Sometimes God does things in miraculous ways but most of the time he uses common tools for that purpose.   Either way, it\u2019s God who\u2019s supplying the need.  This concept works not only with manna and crops, but also with my health, job, and the many other concerns of life.  I thank God for &#8220;the manna&#8221; but also for the ordinary, everyday provision for life.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord does, indeed, \u201cgive us this day our daily bread.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Give us this day our daily bread.
