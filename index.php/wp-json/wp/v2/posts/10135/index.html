Now, the way to God is opened and I have sure, absolute promises upon which to take my stand. So, that\u2019s what I do. I respond in belief and then do all I can to nurture that hope I\u2019ve been so graciously given. One of the ways I do that, according to the writer of Hebrews, is to worship with fellow believers. In spite of the fact that some folks don\u2019t think it is necessary or worth the time, I\u2019m to see it as a valuable component of the life of faith. As part of a worshiping community my connection to Jesus is strengthened, my understanding of the things of God is deepened, and opportunities for serving the Lord are provided. Some may think they know better or that they have bigger fish to fry. I see it as one of several ways in which I more firmly grasp my hold on the things of God. After all, Jesus has already done the heavy lifting here. My being faithful to his Church and all the other disciplines of the Christian life is nothing in comparison to his bleeding and dying on the cross.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Thank the Lord for the gift of the Church, the Body of Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Church attendance Hebrews 10: Not avoiding worshiping together as some do but spurring each other on.
