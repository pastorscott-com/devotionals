If I build impressive church structures and amass great wealth yet fail at these key points God will not only be disappointed in me, he\u2019ll take action against me. Sometimes we act as though all this &#8220;obey God&#8221; business is kind of theoretical; not literal, but something that happens only in an ideal world. We really think that we can pretty much do what we want and tip our hat to God once in a while and he\u2019ll be satisfied with that. In this passage I see that no matter how much I do in the Name of the Lord I never get beyond the requirement of simply living the way he has shown me to live. If I ignore that, then all the &#8220;Temples&#8221; I might build are meaningless in his eyes.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we think we\u2019re so valuable to the Lord that we don\u2019t have to obey him \u2013 well, we\u2019d better think again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Obedience is required 1Kings 11: He hasn&#8217;t lived the way I have shown him, hasn&#8217;t done what I have wanted, and hasn&#8217;t followed directions or obeyed orders&#8230;.
