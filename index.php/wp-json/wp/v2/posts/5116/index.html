Here he is, still sitting in the ashes.  His children are still dead.  His wealth is still gone. He\u2019s still in the agony of his affliction.  Job isn\u2019t now humbly spiritual because God has fixed everything or even explained everything to him.  So far as I know, Job never learns what this is all about; that it\u2019s all a test designed to answer the question, &#8220;Does he serve God for nothing?&#8221;  Job has proved the Lord&#8217;s point though.  Through it all, even when he\u2019s struggling with the issues at hand, Job maintains his righteousness and trust in God.  Now, God has spoken, revealing himself to Job, challenging him to respond to his own questions.  Job responds, &#8220;I babbled on about things far beyond me.&#8221;  This meeting with God makes all of Job&#8217;s questions moot.  God is God and, even when life is unfair and perplexing, well, God is still God.  In his trial, Job tries to state his case; to explain himself to his friends.  More, he tries to explain God.  This suffering man now realizes that he\u2019s been trying to deal with the details of life but has lost sight of this huge, overpowering truth: God is God.  In my life, even as I struggle with circumstances that don&#8217;t fit my theology, I must, after all my babbling on about how I think things are, remember this: God is God.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even when I don\u2019t understand&#8230;even when I don\u2019t like how things are going\u2026even then, God is God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God is God Job 42: I babbled on about things far beyond me.
