Jeremiah sees the sin and rebellion of his people, not as a cultural or educational or behavioral problem, but as a heart problem.  Their failure isn&#8217;t the result of misunderstanding and it isn&#8217;t a mistake.  They sin because they\u2019re sinners at heart.  The great need of their lives isn\u2019t that they straighten up and act right.  They need heart surgery; a change at the very foundation of their being.  In this passage the Lord describes this change.  On the first level, it\u2019s a change that will take place following the Babylonian exile but on a larger scale it\u2019s a change Jesus, the Son of God, will bring.  In fact, the writer of the New Testament book of Hebrews returns to this passage to describe the new spiritual reality Christ has brought into the world.  God&#8217;s Law is no longer written on stone tablets.  Rather, it\u2019s written on the hearts of those who receive Jesus as their Lord and Savior.  Jeremiah sees the need and he has the promise from God that the need will be met, but he can\u2019t imagine how it will all be brought about.<br \/>\nTake Away: We need more than to change our behavior \u2013 we need for our hearts to be transformed by the grace of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s Law in my heart Jeremiah 31: I will put my law within them &#8212; write it on their hearts!
