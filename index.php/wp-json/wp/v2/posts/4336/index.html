By God\u2019s help they defeated the army of Sihon.  Then they took on Og of Bashan.  Before we ever meet the giant Goliath we meet Og.  He\u2019s huge.  In fact, after he\u2019s defeated his bed is put on display.  It\u2019s over thirteen feet long!  As they say, \u201cthe bigger they come the harder they fall.\u201d  The Lord supercharges the Israelites and down comes Og and his army.  Before long it will be time for this current generation of Israelites to do what their parents refused to do.  They\u2019re to cross the Jordan and take the land of Canaan as their own.  This time, rather than cower in fear they\u2019re to think of Sihon and his army and how, by the strength of the Lord, that army was crushed.  When they see the big guys of Canaan they\u2019re to picture the fallen Og and his big, iron bed that is on display.  The victories of the past are to give them courage and faith to move forward to even greater victories.  That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be for me too.  God has been good to me.  By his grace I\u2019ve come a long way.  I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if the biggest challenges of life lie ahead.  I\u2019m to let the work of God in my life in days gone by be a source of strength in my life in the events yet to come.<br \/>\nTake Away: As we remember what the Lord has done for us in the past we\u2019re encouraged to trust in in current and future situations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you\u2019ve seen one giant you\u2019ve seen them all Deuteronomy 3: God is going to do the same thing to all the kingdoms over there across the river.
