Her identity in history is somewhat a mystery, although most believe she&#8217;s a ruler of what is now Yemen or Ethiopia. The point of Scripture is that God keeps his word to Solomon and blesses him in every way. In fact, God blesses him to the point that he becomes well known outside his own region and that the stories told about him are so fantastic that this national leader comes to see for herself. We\u2019re told that she isn\u2019t disappointed. The purpose here isn\u2019t so much to elevate Solomon as it is to proclaim God\u2019s faithfulness to him. Through this blessing, God\u2019s Name is made known even in far off Sheba (wherever that actually is.) When God\u2019s people are faithful to him he can lift them to the point that even those outside the direct influence of the Lord will take notice and come to see for themselves. At least that\u2019s our Lord\u2019s take on the story. In Matthew 12 he says that this heathen woman came from a great distance to meet Solomon and that her act will judge those who have every opportunity and reason to come into the presence of the very Son of God but don\u2019t make the effort. A result of God\u2019s blessing is that it gets the attention of the world.<br \/>\nTake Away: The lives of the people of the Lord are a testimony to the greatness of God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Come and see for yourself 2 Chronicles 9: The Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon\u2019s reputation.
