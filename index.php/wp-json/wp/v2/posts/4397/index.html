I won&#8217;t give up on you; I won&#8217;t leave you.  Strength! Courage!<br \/>\nSome people cast long shadows: David, King of Israel; Abraham, Father of Faith; Moses, Law Giver.  The only leader the people of Israel have ever known is now dead.  Getting used to life without the steady guidance of Moses is going to take some getting used to and that\u2019s especially true for their new national leader.  Joshua\u2019s already a proven leader but that leadership has always been under the authority of Moses.  As Joshua staggers under the weight of his new responsibility the Lord speaks to him, probably in a way and at a level that Joshua has never before experienced.  The great Promise Maker makes a wonderful commitment to him.  Moses is gone but God is not.  The same God who spoke to Moses now will speak to Joshua.  That same Presence will remain.  God&#8217;s faithfulness continues.  Today, I thank God for the \u201cMoses figures\u201d in my life.  These people have provided me with leadership, advice, and strength.  Still, humanity is limited.  Things, and people, change.  Sometimes, in fact, with the passing of time our roles reverse.  As it was for Moses and then Joshua I place the weight of my hope on the firm Rock of my Salvation.  He won&#8217;t give up on me and he won\u2019t forsake me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank God for people who influence our lives for good, but even more, thank God for his steady faithfulness through the years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s faithfulness continues Joshua 1: Moses my servant is dead\u2026In the same way I was with Moses, I&#8217;ll be with you.
