Still, it seems that, like a symphony, each story is a variation on one theme: that when people have faith they act on that faith. These miracles all start with a need and the promise of God. Then, the person has to take action in preparation for God to move. In one story we see soldiers digging ditches in the desert in preparation for water to miraculously flow into them. Now we have a widow with just a little oil being told to go out and borrow jars from everyone she can. When she starts pouring oil out of her meager supply she fills all the jars she collected. It\u2019s only when she runs out of jars that she runs out of oil. So often we take our needs to God and then stand back to watch what he does. However, in this, and the other stories, we see that God invites us to partner with him in what he does for us. No doubt, he does the greater work; after all, anyone can collect jars. Only God can fill them all from such a limited supply. Lord, help me to be a &#8220;jar collector.&#8221; Help me to be a person doing my part in working with you as you accomplish your purposes in my life and in this world.<br \/>\nTake Away: What does the Lord call you to today that will prepare for what he intends to do in your life tomorrow?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bring your vessels not a few 2Kings 4: He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it.
