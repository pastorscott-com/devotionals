She relies on her intelligence, her beauty, and the support of all those who are fasting before the Lord over the outcome. She issues not one, but two invitations to the King to attend lavish dinners. Xerxes is fascinated and filled with curiosity about all this. Then there\u2019s Haman who\u2019s also invited. His ego is so great that he never sees the trap Esther has laid for him. When the time is right Esther speaks and the end result is that Haman is hanged on the gallows he built for her uncle and Xerxes grants her permission to act in his name to save her people. A few devotional observations can be made here. Esther uses her natural gifts in her service of the Lord. People fast over this and God hears. The result is that the people of God are protected and saved. I\u2019m to bring my \u201cA\u201d game to my service of the Lord, giving it my best while at the same time knowing that it\u2019s all for nothing without the intervention of the Lord. I also need to remember that I\u2019m part of a larger family of believers who will join me in petitioning the Lord for his help. As I give my best and as my family of faith joins me God moves to make all the difference in the world.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord loves working in partnership with us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My \u201cA\u201d game Esther 7: So Haman was hanged on the very gallows that he had built for Mordecai.
