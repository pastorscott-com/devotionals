Now, Zephaniah says, the Lord is about to bring an end to all the rebellion. God\u2019s man advises those who have swam against the tide to focus their attention on the Lord and center their lives on doing the right thing even if they\u2019re alone in doing it. In this day, I can\u2019t force everyone to do the right thing but that doesn\u2019t stop me from righteous living. I want to influence everyone I can for Christ, but whether or not I&#8217;m successful in that, I can commit myself to walk in the ways of the Lord. Zephaniah is certain that the \u201cDay of God\u2019s anger\u201d is coming but he\u2019s also convinced that there is a way of living that prepares us for that sure day.<br \/>\nTake Away: As Joshua of old says: \u201cAs for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Standing alone if necessary Zephaniah 2: Seek God, all you quietly disciplined people.
