On one hand, he\u2019s talking about the restoration of his people.  They\u2019re broken, almost to the point of extinction.  If their condition is described as though they are one person, we would say that individual has been beaten to the point that he or she is unrecognizable.  God&#8217;s salvation is coming but at this point things don&#8217;t look very good.  It makes perfect sense to us that the writers of the New Testament are reminded of this passage as they see what happens to Jesus.  The Jews are God&#8217;s people and Jesus is God&#8217;s Man.  Its sin that nearly destroys the Jews and it\u2019s the burden of our sins that takes Jesus to Calvary.  Physically, God\u2019s people are practically destroyed and the same can be said of Jesus.  Yes, it\u2019s easy enough for us to see the connection.   However, we don&#8217;t have to walk away from this passage with a vision of &#8220;a ruined face, disfigured past recognition&#8221; on our minds.  We do need to spend time gazing at that face, absorbing the full impact of what happens at the cross.  Then, we can move on.  Isaiah describes an amazing transformation saying, &#8220;Just watch my servant blossom!\u201d That\u2019s exactly what we see at the garden tomb that first Easter morning. Israel is to be restored by the grace of God. Jesus rises from the grave, victor over sin and death. Praise His Name!<br \/>\nTake Away: The story of salvation doesn\u2019t end at the cross.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two prophecies for the price of one Isaiah 52: He didn&#8217;t even look human.
