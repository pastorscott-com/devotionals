Do what he tells you. And that&#8217;s it.<br \/>\nThe book of Ecclesiastes is about a wise man&#8217;s search for meaning.  That search takes on a pessimistic flavor as he tries one thing and then another, concluding that it\u2019s all just &#8220;smoke&#8221; that quickly vanishes.  As he nears his conclusion he says that life passes quickly as the body begins to wear out.  In other words, life, in general, is just so much smoke.  Obviously, this book is not a Gospel.  It doesn&#8217;t conclude with a resurrection and words of hope.  Instead, it simply winds down with the big questions left pretty much unanswered.  Well, kind of.  When Solomon has considered everything from constructing impressive buildings to collecting words of wisdom, from living a pleasure-focused life to making the most of one&#8217;s youth he concludes that it\u2019s all smoke.  Basically he says that everything that people think brings meaning to life can be dismissed as failing to live up to expectations.  Now, in his final words, he concludes that meaning must come from outside of all that.  The book of Genesis starts with &#8220;In the beginning, God&#8230;.&#8221;  This book of Ecclesiastes concludes with &#8220;In the end, God&#8230;.&#8221;  Meaning to life only comes through the Creator of life.  Really, Solomon has done the best he can do at this point in history.  There&#8217;s more, in fact a whole lot more, but we have to turn ahead in time to those Gospels I mentioned for that part of the story.<br \/>\nTake Away: Meaning to life only comes through the Creator of life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When all is said and done&#8230; Ecclesiastes 12: Fear God.
