Part of the joy of Christmas is the \u201clonging with hope\u201d aspect of it that we highlight on the first Sunday of Advent each year.  Still, there\u2019s a danger of so looking forward to something in the future that we forget to live in the present.  Life isn\u2019t all about tomorrow, for good or bad.  Life is lived in the present.  It has no rewind or fast forward buttons.  In this passage Jesus reminds us that God is with us \u201cright now.\u201d  We remember wonderful blessings in the past and appreciate what the Lord did for us then.  We also look to the future with confidence in faith that the same good, gracious God will be with us in that day.  Still, it\u2019s right now that\u2019s most under my control.  Not that I control the circumstances of right now, but I have some say about how I will live in those circumstances.  So, one thing I gain from this passage is the reminder to live in this present moment; to appreciate the good things and to trust God with the not-so-good things.  The other thing that comes to mind is the calm, certain assurance that God is, indeed, doing something \u201cright now.\u201d  I may be praying for a great revival to come to my church, longing for that day to come.  I may be looking forward to some major life event like the birth of a grandchild or some special anniversary.  However, Jesus tells me that God is also doing things right here and right now.  He\u2019s working in my life, walking with me in these ordinary days of life.  After all, the great mystery of Christmas is the incarnation, Emmanuel, God with us.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I need to be more aware of the blessings of life right now and not always focusing on some future blessing.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living in the present Matthew 6: Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now.
