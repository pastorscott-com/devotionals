The day will come when they\u2019ll be freed from the rule of Darius and will, instead, be ruled by a King sent from God.  That king will come into Jerusalem, not riding a mount of war, but upon a mount that symbolizes humility and peace, a donkey.  It will be 500 years before that event takes place and then at least 2000 years more before the promise Zechariah gives is totally fulfilled. However, the \u201cdonkey riding King\u201d has already ridden into Jerusalem.  It happened when Jesus, the Messiah, rode a borrowed donkey into Jerusalem on the day we call Palm Sunday.
