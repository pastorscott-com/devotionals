Enter the silence.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know much about silence.  My life is filled with noise: music on the radio, something on the TV, conversation.  Even when I pray, I refer to my prayer list.  After all I have much to say to the Lord.  I&#8217;d say my list is a pretty good one, with not only requests, but plenty of praises as well.  Still, though, Jeremiah says that there&#8217;s a time for silence.  The thing is that when I try to be silent before God my mind races off in a dozen directions at once.  The prophet specifically says silence is good for times when life is hard and recommends our getting away from it all, not to talk to God but to experience silence before him.  Many years before Jeremiah David described the &#8220;quiet waters&#8221; experience.  He said it was there that the Lord restored his soul.  I need to work on &#8220;entering the silence.&#8221;  Maybe I need to pass through the &#8220;Lord, here&#8217;s my list&#8221; and the &#8220;when I finish here I need to do this&#8221; stages so I can arrive at the &#8220;enter the silence&#8221; stage.
