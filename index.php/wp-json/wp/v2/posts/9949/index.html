He\u2019s supernatural, coming down out of heaven.  He\u2019s majestic with shafts of light blazing out of him.  He\u2019s powerful, rolling away the stone.  Then, what does he do?  He has a seat on the stone he speaks calmly and reassuringly and matter-of-factly to the women.  It\u2019s almost as though they don\u2019t know whether to bow down to him or invite him out for breakfast.  Then the resurrected Jesus makes his appearance.  It\u2019s the same way.  Here\u2019s the victor over death, freshly raised from the grave; yet he greats them with a cheery \u201cgood morning\u201d as though they are just old friends who happen to meet at the mall.  The women, though, know just what to do in this case.  They bow before him.  Jesus, still in an apparent light hearted mood tells them not to be afraid, but to go and tell the disciples that \u201cplan A\u201d is still in order and they&#8217;re to meet him at the designated spot in Galilee.  This first Easter morning is awesome &#8212; holy.  It\u2019s also happy, joyous, and just a little light hearted.  It\u2019s an interesting balance and the Church should do all it can to capture this wonderful mixture as it proclaims the resurrection of Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s the resurrection that makes Christianity the happy, hope-filled religion that it is.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This angel got the job all the angels wanted Matthew 28: He rolled back the stone and then sat on it.
