He graphically describes people&#8217;s betrayal of God as adultery.  The picture is ugly and the images are &#8220;R&#8221; rated.  Not only that, but Ezekiel offers them no hope.  God, he says, is done with them.  Even if the sexual content of this passage didn&#8217;t earn an &#8220;R&#8221; the violence Ezekiel says is coming would.  Again, this isn\u2019t a warm, fuzzy passage!  The Lord doesn&#8217;t want it to be this way.  Even after his people committed spiritual adultery with other gods and nations he reached out to them.  The problem was that they wanted none of it.  No matter what God did or said, they refused to respond.  They turned their backs on God and acted in ways intended to send him the message that they didn&#8217;t want anything to do with him.  It could have been different.  His plan was to clean them up, to make them into a holy people, his very own.  In fact, that&#8217;s still his plan.  However, that will come in a different generation.  For now, he&#8217;s finished with them and he&#8217;s going to clean the place up by getting rid of them.  Their children and grandchildren will get another chance, not them.  The Lord won&#8217;t force us to come to him.  We can break his heart and we can make him angry but he&#8217;ll never force us to do the right thing even when it&#8217;s for our own good.  I may not be able to solve the needs of my life but I do have the final say as to whether or not God is allowed to do so.  If I agree, he&#8217;ll go to work, cleaning up the mess I&#8217;ve made.  If I refuse, there&#8217;s a very real danger that he&#8217;ll let me continue down the path I insist on traveling and in so doing, will arrive at the destination I&#8217;ve persisted in reaching.<br \/>\nTake Away: We may not be able to solve the needs of our lives but we have been granted the responsibility and ability to allow the Lord to do so.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t push God too far Ezekiel 24: I wanted to clean you up, but you wouldn&#8217;t let me.
