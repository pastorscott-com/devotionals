Our Lord has spent considerable time with them and while those exchanges weren\u2019t necessarily friendly, they were convincing.  These men thrive on debate and Jesus gives them more debate than they want: winning the argument each time.  He also proves his words by his deeds.  On this very day Jesus is dining with Lazarus, the man Jesus called forth from the grave.  At first, the leaders investigated Jesus and his miracles.  At some point they saw the truth: that the miracles were real, confirming his identity.  The problem is that Jesus isn\u2019t one of them.  In fact, he\u2019s a nobody from an unimportant place.  Surely, the Messiah will be an \u201cinsider\u201d and not an \u201coutsider\u201d as is Jesus.  They held back, at first, sure that they\u2019d find a flaw in all this that would prove them right.  When that flaw wasn\u2019t found they hardened their position.  Now, we find that they&#8217;re locked in to it.  God has allowed them to be the unbelievers they choose to be all along.  In this, the Lord didn\u2019t have to shut them out.  Rather, he let them be where they wanted to be all along.  As I think about this, I hear the slam of the door of the Ark way back in the book of Genesis.  I see the thousands of Israelites being marched off into captivity.  I fear I see a future Day of Judgment in which people who would not believe are allowed to spend an eternity in that unbelief, apart from God and hope.  It\u2019s serious business to refuse to believe.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Belief is a matter of the will.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The slam of the door of the Ark John 12: First they wouldn\u2019t believe, then they couldn\u2019t.
