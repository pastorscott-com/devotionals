Dead animals and a plague of miserable boils have struck the land.  As Goliath will stager before falling many years in the future, Egypt is near the end.  All the wealth and power Joseph brought to Egypt is draining away.  One has to believe that the people of Egypt and even the advisors of the king are practically begging him to end this by surrendering to the demand from God that the people of Israel be set free.  As Moses promises yet another massive display of God\u2019s power, he explains the absurd stubbornness of Pharaoh.  This is God\u2019s doing.  Pharaoh hasn\u2019t given in because he can\u2019t give in.   After centuries of seeming silence God is making himself known once again.  When he\u2019s finished with Pharaoh the whole world will know about the God of the Israelites.  On one hand I squirm a bit in my spirit as I see Pharaoh stripped of his free will, suffering the consequences of his earlier stubbornness.  On the other hand, though, I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s the Almighty who\u2019s doing it.  Who has a right to question what the Creator of all things does?  Pharaoh\u2019s life is going to bring glory to God, not only throughout the world of his day, but throughout history as well.  As I read about the plagues I\u2019m reminded that every life will, sooner or later, bring glory to God.<br \/>\nTake Away: Ultimately, God is sovereign and ultimately, every life will yield to that truth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The stubbornness of Pharaoh Exodus 9: But for one reason only I\u2019ve kept you on your feet&#8230; Things continue to go downhill for mighty Egypt.
