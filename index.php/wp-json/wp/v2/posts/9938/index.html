Sunlight poured from his face.<\/p>\n<p>To some extent I don\u2019t think the Church has ever fully grasped the Person of Jesus.  It took hundreds of years for the doctrine of the Trinity to be established and it\u2019s been \u201cofficial\u201d now for over 1600 years.  Still, if you talk to some people they\u2019re still back in the early years of Christian theology and not convinced at all that the Trinity doctrine has it right.  When we think about the Person of Jesus there\u2019s always a tug a war between \u201che\u2019s God\u201d and \u201che\u2019s man.\u201d  In the pages of the Gospels we watch Jesus, the man.  He grows weary and sleeps, he gets thirsty, and he bleeds.  We also watch Jesus, the Lord.  He forgives sins and tells his disciples that he and the Father are one.  In this passage, as Jesus takes three disciples up on the mountain, the humanity of Jesus is overwhelmed by this divinity.  The disciples see it as light that pours out of him.  This isn\u2019t the Jesus they ate supper with last light.  This isn\u2019t the Jesus who slept through the storm.  This is God.  Peter, James, and John don\u2019t know what to say or do as they experience this Jesus.  Still, maybe by instinct, they do the right thing: they fall flat on their faces in reverence and awe.  Know what?  This radiant-light-pouring-out-of-his-face Jesus is just as much Jesus as the hungry, sleepy, dying-on-the-cross Jesus.  Falling down in worship before him is an excellent response.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We may struggle with the person of Jesus, but worshiping him is always the right response.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intentionally or not, the disciples did the right thing Matthew 17: His appearance changed from the inside out, right before their eyes.
