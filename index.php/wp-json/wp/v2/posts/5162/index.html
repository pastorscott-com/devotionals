Actually, there\u2019s a lot of information on Korah and his descendants. These psalm writing &#8220;sons&#8221; are really descendants of the Levite named Korah who challenges the leadership of Moses and Aaron way back in the book of Numbers. He dies at the hand of God in that rebellion, but it seems his descendants continue on and here we see that they\u2019re among the Levites David assigns to be worship leaders. It\u2019s good to remember that even though there\u2019s spiritual failure in our past (or that of our family) that we still have opportunity to be well used by God. Great-great grandpa might have challenged God&#8217;s chosen leaders (or might have been a slave owner or been hung a horse thief) but that doesn\u2019t make us of any less value in God&#8217;s sight. This kind of thinking sounds pretty old hat to me and my fellow Americans. We\u2019re all individualists anyway and think it\u2019s wonderful to be able to say, &#8220;I did it my way.&#8221; To people through most of history, the &#8220;my way&#8221; approach is unheard of. They see life from the group&#8217;s point of view and speak in terms of &#8220;our way.&#8221; That means that their culture sees grandpa&#8217;s failures as the failure of all those descended from him. In their way of thinking, the stigma of failure is passed down from generation to generation. Every time we glance at the top of a Psalm and see that it comes from Korah&#8217;s clan we\u2019re seeing redemption at work! In more current terms, these psalms remind me that God forgives my past failure and is very willing to use me as a worker in his Kingdom today.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Redemption Psalm 84: &#8220;A Korah Psalm&#8221; This is one of the Psalms written by the sons of Korah.
