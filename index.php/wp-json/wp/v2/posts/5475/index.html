One of them is that there are &#8220;tides of the Spirit.&#8221;  Even as the ocean has times of high and low tide, so do we (individuals as well as churches) experience such cycles in the spiritual realm.  In my career as a pastor I have seen churches that seemed to be doing everything right but weren&#8217;t seeing the results one might expect.  Then, to our delight, one positive thing kicks off a whole series of positive things.  Suddenly, the efforts that had been fruitless before take on a new life and wonderful things start happening.  I laughingly told someone once that I was thinking of writing a book telling how our church had seen significant gains over a two year period.  The problem was that I had no idea of what to write; we were basically doing all the same things we had done in the years previous when there was nothing special happening.  I&#8217;m sure that there were things associated with those memorable days that I simply didn&#8217;t see.  For instance, secret prayer by some saints of God comes to mind.  Still, the difference was that God moved, not because we got all our ducks in a row, but because of his own schedule and purpose.  We were the happy recipients of it.  Today, Isaiah reminds me, not only that there are tides of the Spirit, but that I must seize the moment when the tide is in.  I move because God is moving.  Because God is moving, some doors that have been closed to me might just be open for a while.  You might say that when the tide is in it\u2019s a good time to take a swim!<br \/>\nTake Away: As people who live in the Spirit we move when the Lord moves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Surf\u2019s up!
