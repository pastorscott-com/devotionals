He believes that the gospel will be advanced in entirely new ways as a result of his facing whatever it is that he must face there.  Frankly, I\u2019m not clear as to whether or not this is the Lord\u2019s express will for Paul.  It may be that this is mostly Paul\u2019s idea and that the Lord has warned him but also assured him that he can get good out of what is coming.  On the other hand, this may be exactly God\u2019s plan.  I just don\u2019t know.  Paul\u2019s friends, though, know what they want.  They want Paul to stay out of Jerusalem and away from the trouble that awaits him there.  The great Apostle, though, is having none of it.  He\u2019s bound for Jerusalem and nothing they say is going to change his mind.  At this point they do the only reasonable thing: they hand it all off to the Lord.  Why try to press the debate with Paul?  Why lay awake at night and worry about it?  Sooner or later we find ourselves right where they are.  We don\u2019t agree with the course of action a respected brother or sister in Christ is taking, but they&#8217;re convinced that it\u2019s the right thing to do.  At that point, we need to decide to take our hands off and trust the Lord with it.  From then on, we can go on loving and supporting our friend without trying to change their mind or even holding an \u201cI told you so\u201d in reserve.  Know what?  The Master really can handle it.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: There\u2019s a time for letting others work out their own lives; for letting the Lord and them handle things without our help. <\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s out of our hands Acts 21: \u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands now,\u201d we said. \u201cMaster, you handle it.\u201d In spite of repeated warnings from God\u2019s people that this trip to Jerusalem will end with him in chains Paul remains convinced that this is what the Lord wants.
