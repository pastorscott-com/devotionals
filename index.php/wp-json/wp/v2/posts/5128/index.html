What a blessing to look inward and see a heart made right and kept right.  How pleasant it is to think serene thoughts, imagining soft, easy-going days in which I relax in the assurance of God&#8217;s pleasure with my life.  It&#8217;s too bad that that&#8217;s not the message of this Psalm at all.  David is under attack and he&#8217;s running for his life.  He&#8217;s been accused of all kinds of failure, including spiritual failure.  If his enemies get their hands on him he&#8217;s finished.  This isn&#8217;t a day at the beach.  This is war.  And it\u2019s in the middle of this war that David looks to God for help and vindication.  As some of his life&#8217;s most difficult days rage all around him, he looks upward and finds hope.  He looks inward and finds peace.  While I really do love soft &#8220;safe days&#8221; I know that the real test of God&#8217;s work in my life is out on the battle field.  If I can sense his pleasure with me and find inner peace there, well, I can find it anywhere.<br \/>\nTake Away: Life isn\u2019t always easy but the Lord is with us and in us even on hard days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Safe days Psalm 7: I&#8217;m feeling so fit, so safe: made right, kept right.
