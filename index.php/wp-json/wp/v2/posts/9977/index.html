Usually, as we\u2019re praying I can hear the church \u201cwaking up\u201d as folks start arriving.  Generally, I like what I hear.  I\u2019m a real fan of happy chatter, children playing, folks sounding glad to see one another.  Sometimes, though, I can tell that the morning isn\u2019t going well for some.  They\u2019ve met with some issue or another on the way to church.  Maybe there\u2019s some family argument going on.  Others have things to take care of when they get to church.  They arrive and want to get past the friendly greetings as quickly as possible so they can hurry and make copies before their class begins.  I appreciate their dedication but wish I could get them to relax a bit.  In the passage I\u2019m reading today Jesus notes that some people are always worried about one thing or another.  His examples aren\u2019t just frivolous stuff either.  They\u2019re concerned about having food to eat and clothes to wear.  In soothing tones our Lord points to how God supplies the needs of nature and assures them that they\u2019re more valuable to him than all else.  I understand that life brings unexpected, last minute concerns to us so I\u2019m not being critical of those folks who anxiously wait for the copier to warm up.  Still, I have the idea that their day will go much better if they\u2019ll make it their practice to join us in prayer, enjoying some quiet time in the presence of the Lord before launching into a busy Sunday morning.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If I view the Lord as a stern unyielding judge I have every reason to be stressed \u2013 if I see him as my loving Heavenly Father I can rest in the assurance of his provision for me.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you think copiers pick up on our stress level?
