They follow him from place to place and when he isn\u2019t around he\u2019s the topic of conversation.  Jesus is a celebrity.  When Jesus sets up shop on a grassy hillside near the lake, the crowd swells to thousands.  It\u2019s at this point that Jesus calls Philip over to ask him where they can buy food to feed this huge number of people.  Philip, practical to the core, quickly does the math, responding to Jesus that even if there was a bakery nearby that there\u2019s no way that they can buy enough bread for this crowd.  In an aside, the gospel writer tells us that the Lord already has a plan and that they only reason he asks this question to Philip is for Philip\u2019s own benefit.  Philip, though, at least at first, misses the lesson altogether.  He quickly estimates the size of the crowd, considers the cost of bread, and comes up with a figure of 200 silver pieces which, rather being enough to pay the cost of actually feeding the people, would at least give them a bite to eat before going home.  Apparently, Philip is a fine bean counter.  He\u2019d probably have been a better choice for treasurer than Judas!  Still, Jesus knows what he\u2019s doing.  He knows that Philip is a practical person and that he needs to learn to trust the Lord to meet needs beyond his resources.  Know what?  I think I\u2019m Philip and maybe you are too.  I\u2019ve sat in church board meetings in which the first response to everything wasn\u2019t \u201cDo you think this is what the Lord wants us to do?\u201d but, instead was, \u201cCan we afford it?\u201d  Philip needed to have his faith stretched.  We practical people do too.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We need to be people of faith first.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Faith stretcher John 6: He said this to stretch Philip\u2019s faith.
