Hezekiah&#8217;s sick and Isaiah comes to him with the news that God says he won\u2019t recover. When Hezekiah pleads with the Lord, Isaiah returns with the news that God has heard his prayer and is going to add 15 years to his life. Also, Isaiah orders medicinal help in the form of a fig plaster. Hezekiah (foolishly brave if you ask me) asks for some kind of sign and Isaiah offers him a choice of the shadow on the sundial moving forward or backward. The king says, &#8220;Back&#8221; and that&#8217;s just what happens. As I said, there\u2019s a lot to think about here. For instance, there\u2019s the fig plaster. Did God give Isaiah a remedy for the illness or is Isaiah just having those caring for Hezekiah do something to bring relief until the healing takes place? These days the church often prays that God will &#8220;direct the surgeon&#8217;s hands&#8221; as an operation is performed. Is that similar to Isaiah saying God will heal but then ordering medicine as well? Then there&#8217;s the shadow of the sundial. When this happens it&#8217;s seen as a miracle, but now, with our knowledge of the nature of the world, it stands as one of the greatest miracles of the Bible. Talking about &#8220;moving heaven and earth&#8221; to accomplish something takes on a whole new meaning when I read this account! Then there\u2019s the 15 years. Hezekiah, by my math, is probably 39 years young when this happens. The 15 years will take him all the way to the ripe old age of 54. His broken heart at the prospect of dying in the prime of his life is a very human response. The additional 15 years basically gives him a &#8220;normal&#8221; life span for that day and age. Is it reasonable for a person to plead with God for more time, a longer life? At what point does a person say, &#8220;God&#8217;s will be done \u2013 I\u2019m ready to go if he chooses to take me&#8221;? We see in the story that later on, when emissaries from distant Babylon visit that Hezekiah foolishly shows them all the wealth of his kingdom. Isaiah tells him that he&#8217;s made a major mistake that will result in his own descendants being carried off as captives. Hezekiah more or less brushes it off. Had he died would this chain of events still happen? Does God answer one prayer that opens the way for disaster later on? Sorry, but I don&#8217;t have the answers. However, as you can see, I have plenty of questions!<br \/>\nTake Away: Some issues in the Bible that don\u2019t make or break our faith are fun to think about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have a few questions 2Kings 20: I&#8217;ve just added fifteen yours to your life.
