They\u2019re lost to the point of having no hope of returning.  The way back has to be provided by God, Himself.  So how can a righteous God redeem an unrighteous people?  The answer is in this powerful chapter of Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy.  The horrible sins of his nation will be gathered up and put on the shoulders of the holy Suffering Servant.  Their sins will become his sins and as the meek lamb being sacrificed in their rituals symbolically dies for their sins, he\u2019ll literally give his all to restore them to God.  God&#8217;s plan: my hope.  The message of salvation was desperately needed by those of Isaiah&#8217;s day and it\u2019s just as necessary today.  The wonderful thing is that it&#8217;s all true.  In spite of my sin, my rebellion, and my &#8220;wandering off&#8221; God is providing a way back through Jesus Christ.<br \/>\nTake Away: God&#8217;s plan: my hope.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s plan: my hope Isaiah 53: We&#8217;re all like sheep who&#8217;ve wandered off and gotten lost.
