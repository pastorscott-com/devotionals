When some of the disciples eat without going through their prescribed pre-meal washing ritual the Pharisees complain about it to Jesus.  Our Lord responds in force, challenging these men who know better about how they play fast and loose with God\u2019s Laws when it suits them.  Later on, he tells his disciples that worrying too much about what we put into our bodies while ignoring the words and actions that \u201ccome out\u201d of our bodies is rather stupid.  To state it delicately, what enters through the mouth exits elsewhere.  However, what comes out of the mouth has its source in the heart.  So, I wonder what it is that comes out of my heart.  Are my words pure or impure?  Do I lift people with my words or do I demolish them?  What comes out of my mouth tells more about me than what goes in.
