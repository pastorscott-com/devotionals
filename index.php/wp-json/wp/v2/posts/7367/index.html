When it comes to Jeremiah, he keeps him locked up, but can&#8217;t resist talking to him; he hates what he says, but can&#8217;t stop listening.  Once again the prophet&#8217;s being held in the courtyard, and, as things continue to deteriorate, Zedekiah arranges a secret meeting with Jeremiah.  However, he&#8217;s just wasting his time.  At first Jeremiah refuses to answer because he knows Zedekiah won&#8217;t like what he says and will once again refuse to listen to him anyway.  When Zedekiah insists, Jeremiah simply tells him what he&#8217;s told him before: the city will fall and only those who surrender to the invading army will be spared.  Jeremiah is offering Zedekiah the way to life, but he knows Zedekiah will reject it once again.  In the New Testament we find the story of a wealthy young man who comes to Jesus asking the way to life.  When Jesus tells him that the &#8220;way&#8221; is for him to give up everything and become one of his followers the young man sadly turns and walks away.  In the passage before me today I find Zedekiah, like the rich young ruler, rejecting the only hope there is.  How pitiful to be so close and yet so far.  Jeremiah offers Zedekiah hope and Jesus offers the rich young ruler &#8220;life.&#8221;  Both decide to reject what&#8217;s offered in favor of position and wealth and power.  When Jesus, himself, is faced with the same choice he willingly gives up everything and surrenders to his enemies.  This leads to the ordeal of the cross, but it also leads to the resurrection.  So, what are you holding on to that must be released for you to have life?  Today, both Zedekiah and the rich young ruler alike would tell you it is better to let it go because holding on costs too much.<br \/>\nTake Away: Whatever it is that keeps us from the Lord isn\u2019t worth it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Letting it go\u2026gaining it all Jeremiah 38: I&#8217;m telling you this for your own good.
