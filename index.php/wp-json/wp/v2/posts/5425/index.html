We, though, have the whole story; how God&#8217;s Son came to us to remake us into new people, a people who are his very own.  If it can be said that Israel was a &#8220;custom-made&#8221; people it might be added that, through Christ, we\u2019ve undergone an &#8220;extreme make-over&#8221; in which everything about us has been transformed by the work of Jesus.  The result of this &#8220;customizing&#8221; encounter with the Lord is that we become enthusiastic worshipers of God.  Our new native language is the language of praise.  For us, life isn&#8217;t a daily struggle in which we whimper words of complaint and need.  Our first thoughts and the words we most easily say are those of praise to God.  Israel was custom-made for that purpose and we&#8217;ve been made-over for the same thing.  We\u2019re redesigned to praise the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: My purpose is to bring praise, glory, and honor to the Lord<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve experienced an extreme make-over Isaiah 43: &#8230;a people custom-made to praise me.
