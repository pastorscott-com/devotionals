Paul has entrusted congregations to these men and now he writes them letters of encouragement and instruction. The Apostle writes, not always as an overseer, but sometimes as a fellow pastor, a man called by God to proclaim the gospel and shepherd the Church. He pictures himself as one of Jesus\u2019 favorite trophies of grace. That is, he, of all people should be declared too bad, too lost, too committed to sin to ever be saved. In his grace and mercy though, the Lord has done just that. He not only saved Paul but he called him to proclaim the gospel message. Every time he preaches his life is speaking more loudly and eloquently than his words. He sees himself as example number one of just how gracious, forgiving, and merciful God is. If that\u2019s true, then even as I read these words 2000 years after they were written, the very fact that they were written by this \u201cPublic Sinner Number One\u201d speaks as loudly as what he actually writes. Still, having said all that, I\u2019m compelled to add that any minister worth his or her salt shares Paul\u2019s confession of unworthiness. To some extent, no one can properly proclaim the gospel, or even get saved in the first place, unless they read Paul\u2019s words and think, \u201cnot so fast on that \u2018Sinner Number One\u2019 stuff Paul, let me tell you my story.\u201d The bottom line is that if not for Jesus none of us would have a chance.
