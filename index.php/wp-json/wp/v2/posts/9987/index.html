Not long ago Peter and the other disciples promised their loyalty to Jesus.  Now, though, he stands before the Chief Priest, alone.  The disciples have fled in fear but Luke tells us Peter, under cover of darkness has followed.  He\u2019s close enough to see what\u2019s going on but far enough back as to not be identified as a follower of Jesus.  I fear that this describes many Christians and at certain times, maybe most of us.  We\u2019re following, but not \u201cthat\u201d close.  After all, sometimes being a follower of Jesus is just plain unhandy, not to mention possibly dangerous for some.  For instance, someone who doesn\u2019t smell very good needs some personal, up close attention.  If I\u2019m not careful, my revulsion will win out over my discipleship and I won\u2019t even offer a cup of water in Jesus\u2019 Name.  Or, say someone at work isn\u2019t a very nice person.  People tend to give them a wide berth.  Will I get close enough to show them Jesus?  Because of the danger Peter follows, but at a safe distance.  The thing is, before long he isn\u2019t following at all.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I want to follow Jesus closely enough that there\u2019s no doubt that I\u2019m with him.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keeping a safe distance Luke 22: Peter followed, but at a safe distance.
