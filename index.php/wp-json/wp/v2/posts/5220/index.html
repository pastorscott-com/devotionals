It was the first computer I ever built from the ground up, buying the components and putting it all together.  That was six years earlier.  That machine served me well, running 24 hours a day for several years.  After I replaced it with new laptop the old machine was just taking up valuable space.  A friend needed a computer for checking email and the like, so I passed the computer on to him.  When I put that computer into service I knew that someday it would be replaced, but I admit I was somewhat unprepared for the seeming shortness of its value to me.  Some things just don&#8217;t last.  The proverbs writer reminds me today that, while that\u2019s true, some things do last and one of those things is &#8220;truth.&#8221;  In other words, if something was &#8220;so&#8221; 2000 years ago it\u2019s still &#8220;so&#8221; today.  I\u2019m not talking about various truisms here; clearly some things thought to be truth in the past are proven wrong in the long run.  However, in the case of genuine truth, well, it lasts.  For instance, when Jesus says he\u2019s the Way to God that\u2019s an absolute truth.  That fact can never get old and it can never be improved upon.  I know that some folks think that such a claim is narrow minded.  However, by its very nature truth is somewhat exclusive.  Today, then, I remember that some things simply don&#8217;t last so I\u2019m wise to not put the full weight of my trust on them.  I also remember that the eternal truths of God do last.  Jesus said it this way, &#8220;Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.&#8221; (Matthew 24:35)<br \/>\nTake Away: We can depend on the Lord\u2019s truths.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The whole truth and nothing but the truth Proverbs 12: Truth lasts.
