I know how this turns out, but I can&#8217;t help but note the wisdom of his father&#8217;s senior advisors in this. They recommend that Rehoboam be a servant to the people; that he respond with compassionate consideration, showing them respect. The result, they say, will be that he\u2019ll get his own way. That is, they\u2019ll work themselves to death for him. Centuries before Jesus tells his disciples that the greatest should be servant of all, these advisors tell Rehoboam the same thing. This principle applies across the spectrum. It works at national leadership levels, in business, and, yes, in the church as well. Rehoboam doesn&#8217;t get it and ends up with a rebellion on his hands. The same thing happens in other applications as well.
