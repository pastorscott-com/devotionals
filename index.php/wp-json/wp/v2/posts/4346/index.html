Is it that God has given me these rules and regulations and will pay me back with blessings if I keep them?  I don&#8217;t think so.  God doesn&#8217;t lay down arbitrary rules just for the purpose of keeping me in line and he doesn\u2019t treat me like a little child who\u2019s rewarded with a stick of candy if I\u2019m good.  His purposes for me are filled with grace and mercy.  If God says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8221; I can be sure that it\u2019s for my benefit and not his.  My Creator, who knows me better than I know myself says, &#8220;When I created you I hardwired some very specific things about you.  If you want your life to function at its best, here\u2019s how you\u2019re to live.&#8221;  Following these guidelines doesn&#8217;t mean life will be trouble free (after all, there\u2019s that ugly business of the fall in the opening pages of my Bible) but it does mean that I\u2019ll live the best, most satisfying and fulfilled life possible.  Not only that, but by living according to God&#8217;s plan, I\u2019ll be teaching my children the best way to live.  The result will be that my kids will be more likely to adopt my approach to living in a relationship with God and their lives will also be better lived.<br \/>\nTake Away: When I live God\u2019s way, not only is my life better, but I also influence my children to live for God, resulting in their lives also being better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Live long and prosper Deuteronomy 4: Obediently live by his rules and commands which I&#8217;m giving you today so that you&#8217;ll live well and your children after you.
