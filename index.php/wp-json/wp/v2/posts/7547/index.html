After all, it was his gullible foolishness that caused all of this in the first place.  He&#8217;s ready to acknowledge the power and authority of Daniel&#8217;s God.  Darius then turns his attention to the conspirators and their families.  He has them all thrown into the lion&#8217;s den.  God&#8217;s angel has already departed and they come to a horrible end.  As I read this I&#8217;m reminded that Daniel represents God in a wicked and heartless regime.   Nebuchadnezzar, it seems, had a genuine change of heart.  Darius, on the other hand, has been impressed and humbled by Daniel&#8217;s God and from now on he will treat Daniel&#8217;s God with respect.  In other words, Darius&#8217; experience was not nearly as personal as was Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s.  Daniel prospers under Darius and then under Cyrus.  Apparently, neither of these two become worshipers of the Lord but they respect Daniel and his God.  We Christians have something to learn here.  If possible, we want people to become believers; to join us in worship of the only one worthy of worship.  However, we may not always see that happen.  In some cases the best we will see is that others will decide we and our faith have earned their respect.  Hopefully, that will be a first step to something more for them, but that decision is out of our hands.<br \/>\nTake Away: Live in such a way as to influence people for the Lord \u2013 if nothing else, to earn their respect and to cause them to respect the one we worship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earning respect Daniel 6: God&#8230;closed the mouths of the lions.
