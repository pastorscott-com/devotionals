In spite of David&#8217;s continuing to be a defender of Israel Saul has made him public enemy number one. David&#8217;s band is growing, now numbering over 600, but Saul&#8217;s army vastly outnumbers them. Beyond that, David doesn&#8217;t want to fight Saul or any of his countrymen. The nation of Israel is divided. Some are loyal to Saul and others to David. In fact, one group, the Ziphites, betrays David to Saul. They report David&#8217;s whereabouts to Saul and help set up an ambush. It\u2019s nearly successful. At one point Saul almost has David and his men cornered. If not for word of an attack from a real enemy that forces Saul&#8217;s attention elsewhere, David&#8217;s story would end right here. Because of this, this area is called \u201cNarrow Escape.&#8221; So, was the attack by the Philistines at such a critical moment just good fortune for David? I think not. God&#8217;s fingerprints are all over this. Still, it\u2019s interesting that God used the enemies of Israel, the heathens of the land, to deliver David. The lesson for me is that this is a reminder that God is truly sovereign. Even when godless people act in ways intended to destroy, God can give a gentle push in some particular direction and use their sinful act to accomplish good rather than evil. Even when it seems evil has won the day, God is still God, and he\u2019s working in surprising ways in and through it all.<br \/>\nTake Away: When all is said and done it\u2019s the Lord who has said the last word.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hide and seek 1 Samuel 23: Saul was on one side of the mountain, David and his men on the other.
