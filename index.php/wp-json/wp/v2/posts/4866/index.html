A tent has been pitched for the purpose of housing the Ark of the Covenant and that Ark is being brought into Jerusalem for the first time.  King David, himself, leads the procession, joyfully dancing before the Lord.  The great worship leader, Asaph, leads the choir in singing praises to God.  They sing a wonderful song of praise and worship in which they recount the wonders the Lord has performed and declaring &#8220;God is great &#8212; well worth praising!&#8221;  They sing of God&#8217;s goodness and love and holiness.  When the song has ended, the congregation responds with shouts of &#8220;Amen&#8221; and &#8220;Praise God.&#8221;   What a holy event!  Know what, I\u2019m glad that such worship services aren\u2019t just for the pages of the Old Testament.  I\u2019m glad that there are times when the people of God go all out in praising him and that at such times the Lord comes close, filling such holy moments with himself.  This passage reminds me of awesome worship services I\u2019ve been in.  Even more, it creates in me a desire to occupy such holy ground again, real soon!<br \/>\nTake Away: The great worship events of the Bible, along with worship events we\u2019ve experienced personally, provide the inspiration and desire to once again enter into the presence of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Real worship 1 Chronicles 16: God is great &#8212; well worth praising!
