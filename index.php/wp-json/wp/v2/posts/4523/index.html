He calls the people to make a real commitment to God and they gather at Mizpah to do just that. As they&#8217;re praying and fasting their enemies, the Philistines, hear about the meeting but mistake it for preparation for war. They decide to take the initiative and attack first. When word reaches the prayer meeting the people turn to Samuel for leadership. A wonderful indication of the genuineness of their new commitment to God is that they call on Samuel, not to rally troops for battle but&#8230;to pray! He prays and they pray, and God answers. As the Philistine force moves in for the fight God moves in their behalf. Thunder explodes in their midst and the result is panic. As the Philistine forces break ranks and run, Israel pursues, winning a great victory. They chase their enemies all the way past Beth Car. Here Samuel stands a rock as a monument to God&#8217;s help. He names it \u201cEbenezer\u201d or \u201cRock of Help.\u201d Every follower of God has some &#8220;Ebenezars&#8221; in his or her life. These are momentous victories, turning points. Samuel thinks such places are worth marking and remembering. What monuments to God&#8217;s help should I have standing in my life?<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s something powerful about remembering God\u2019s grace, mercy, and help in days gone by.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>X marks the spot 1 Samuel 7: Samuel took a single rock and set it upright&#8230;He named it &#8220;Ebenezer&#8221; (Rock of Help), saying, &#8220;This marks the place where God helped us.&#8221; Samuel&#8217;s first test of leadership comes about because of a revival.
