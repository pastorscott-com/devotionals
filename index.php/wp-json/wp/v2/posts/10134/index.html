Through the centuries the blood continues to flow and on one day each year, in particular, the blood is taken behind the curtain into the Holy of Holies to atone for the sins of the High Priest and all the people. Then, Jesus, the Son of God, comes to make the ultimate blood sacrifice: his own. This High Priest gives himself, and in so doing, finishes the old bloody system once and for good. No more blood and no more curtain. These things that stood as a barrier between God and man are abolished for good, belonging in history books and museums rather than in real life. Jesus creates a new connection between God and man, the curtain removed and no more blood necessary. Today, we follow the Lord\u2019s command to \u201cremember\u201d by receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper. In the cup though, we don\u2019t need blood. The absence of blood is, in itself, a lesson. Because Christ\u2019s blood was shed long ago, just a bit of wine (in my church tradition, its \u201cnew wine\u201d) is all that\u2019s needed.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christ\u2019s sacrifice was what was needed all along and it never needs to be made again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No more blood needed Hebrews 9: He brought together God and his people in this new way.
