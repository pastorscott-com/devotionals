He works out ways to get the exile back.<br \/>\nAfter avenging the terrible thing done to this sister Tamar by murdering his half-brother, Ammon, Absalom has fled, fearing for his own life. Now three years have passed and David&#8217;s general, Joab, thinks it is time for David to reconcile with his son. Earlier, Nathan brought to David a made-up story and confronted him with the memorable words: &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; Now, Joab sends a woman from Tekoa to do a similar thing. She pretends to be the mother of two sons. In her story, one son has killed the other. Now her family is out for revenge by taking the life of her remaining son. David rules compassionately saying he&#8217;ll take care of it. It\u2019s then that the woman challenges David for doing the same thing concerning Absalom. She points out that God seeks ways to bring the exile back and that David should do the same thing. David sees the hand of Joab in this but agrees to at least open the way for his son&#8217;s return. This incident is a mere snapshot taken during a fast moving flow of events, but I\u2019m taken with the wisdom of the woman from Tekoa. Before Jesus ever tells the famous parable, she pictures for us the forgiving mercy of God for the prodigal. She\u2019s one hundred percent correct: &#8220;He works out ways to get the exile back.&#8221; We serve the God of Second Chances.<br \/>\nTake Away: Never give up on God \u2013 after all, he never gives up on us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God provides a way back 2 Samuel 14: God does not take away life.
