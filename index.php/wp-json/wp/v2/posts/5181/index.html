In one verse I hear the story of those who wandered for years in the desert.  When they called out to God he rescued them.  In the next verse, the focus is on those locked up in prison.  Once again, God saves them.  Another verse tells the story of sickness and I\u2019m told that God &#8220;spoke the word&#8221; and they were healed.  Then I\u2019m led to think about sailors out to sea and caught in a mighty storm.  As in all the other verses, they call out to God and he rescues them in the nick of time.  The psalmist sums it all up by saying I ought to think about all this and appreciate God&#8217;s deep love for us.  I don&#8217;t have a dramatic story like those told in this psalm but, in a sense, not having a story is a story of rescue in itself.  Which is better, to have nearly drowned in my sin or to be rescued early in life and not have the ugly scars of sin in the first place?  My story is also a story of God&#8217;s deep love.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes the Lord rescues us from the disaster before it ever has a chance to happen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My story of rescue Psalm 107: If you are really wise, you&#8217;ll think this over &#8212; it&#8217;s time you appreciated God&#8217;s deep love.
