He should be grateful for the kindness of his father in restoring him after had murdered one of his own brothers. It doesn&#8217;t work that way though. Absalom wants more. To be exact, he wants the throne of Israel. With that in mind, he implements a patient plan. First, he begins to play the part of the king, making a regal procession wherever he goes. Then, he sets up shop at the city gate, the place where the community leaders meet to deal with issues under their jurisdiction. Absalom plays the part of the kind, caring friend to all who come. He suggests, ever so gently, that his father, the King, doesn\u2019t care about the common man enough to grant justice. The impact isn&#8217;t immediate, but over time Absalom rises in popularity to the point that he can challenge his father for the throne of Israel. It shouldn&#8217;t be this way. Absalom ought to be the greatest and most committed supporter of David. Instead, he sets himself up to be his father&#8217;s greatest enemy. Sadly, this is how life is sometimes. We befriend people, forgive them, and make ourselves vulnerable to them and then they let us down. It happened to David, and, with Judas, it happened to Jesus too. Frankly, I can&#8217;t control what other people do, right or wrong. All I can do is the right thing and demonstrate the gentleness and mercy of God in my life. It would be better if the result of that were blessed and solid relationships. Sometimes, though, I have to settle for knowing that the Lord is pleased with me for trying. That, of course, is extremely valuable in itself.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes we do the right thing and the results are everything we hoped for. Other times, it doesn\u2019t work out, but there\u2019s still great value in doing the right thing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Simply doing the right thing 2 Samuel 15: Absalom&#8230;stole the hearts of everyone in Israel.
