Now 26 years have passed and Asa\u2019s nation is once again threatened.  This time, though, he turns to the king of Aram for help, sending a \u201cking\u2019s ransom\u201d to him in exchange for his support in the war.  The combined force of Judah and their hired army is victorious and the enemy is defeated.  As Asa celebrates this God\u2019s man Hanani shows up.  He tells Asa that God\u2019s not pleased with him.  In fact, the Lord\u2019s insulted that Asa would trust in Ben-Hadad instead of himself.  The consequence will be a series of wars, one round after another.  I wonder if I, like Asa, insult the Almighty.  Do I turn anywhere but heavenward in dealing with the issues of life?  The very same God who saw me through in the past stands ready to see me through the issues of this day.  In fact, that\u2019s his preference!  The Lord doesn\u2019t say, \u201cWhen you\u2019ve tried everything else without success, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d  Instead, his message is a wonderful word of commitment.  He promises that if I call he\u2019ll answer.  God doesn\u2019t want to be my last chance. Rather, he wants to be my Partner in every issue of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t make God your last resource\u2026he wants to be your first.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Insulting God 2 Chronicles 16: You were foolish to go for human help when you could have had God\u2019s help.
