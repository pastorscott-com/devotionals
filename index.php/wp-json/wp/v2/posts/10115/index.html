It\u2019s tempting to come up with interesting stories or to ride whatever hobby horse is in play at the time, but instead, the minister is to keep his or her teaching in check. God doesn\u2019t call people to the ministry to entertain with stories or to convince others that their political views are the same as God\u2019s. The preaching and teaching is for the good of the kingdom and not an ego trip. Another portion of the minister\u2019s (and everyone else\u2019s for that matter) life is more private. The more successful the public ministry is the greater the temptation to cut corners when no one&#8217;s watching. If the minister drifts off from sound teaching, there\u2019s a chance that someone will point that out. However, if character is lacking, things can get far out of hand before it\u2019s found out. To some extent, ministers have a lot of help keeping a firm grasp on their teaching and preaching, but practically no help at all doing so with matters of personal character. Paul urges Timothy to tend to his knitting on both fronts. This is good advice for ministers of all times and places, and actually, good advice for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The real \u201cyou\u201d is the person you are in private when no one is watching.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tending to my knitting 1Timothy 4: Keep a firm grasp on both your character and your teaching.
