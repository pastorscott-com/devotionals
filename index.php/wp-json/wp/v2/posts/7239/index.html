I believe in being committed to things.  Jesus told us that to be his followers we must take up our crosses daily.  One doesn&#8217;t have to be a theologian to label that as a call to radical commitment.  Today, I see that this &#8220;commitment business&#8221; is a two way street.  Before I ever consider committing to God he\u2019s already committed to me.  He tells his people, &#8220;I&#8217;ve picked you. I haven&#8217;t dropped you&#8221; and, &#8220;don&#8217;t panic.  I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;  Human beings commit to things easily and then back out without a great deal of regret.  That is, we join bowling leagues, or agree to take on some project without a lot of thought.  Then, when circumstances change, we say, &#8220;Sorry, but I just don&#8217;t have the time to do it.&#8221;  Sad to say, that attitude extends beyond bowling leagues to marriage and other &#8220;biggies.&#8221;  God&#8217;s commitments are the opposite of that.  He carefully counts the cost, and, once he commits to something he\u2019s willing to go all the way in that commitment, even to Calvary.   And, this &#8220;committing God&#8221; has made a commitment to me.  He claims me as his own and promises to never forsake me.  That&#8217;s a commitment I can take to the bank.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord commits to something he never turns back from that commitment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s commitments Isaiah 41: I, your God, have a firm grip on you and I&#8217;m not letting go.
