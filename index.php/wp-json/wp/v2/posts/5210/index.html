For instance, before I can focus on the goal I have to know what that goal is.  Right off the voices of the snake oil huskers begin selling me their bill of goods.  They tell me that whatever they\u2019re selling is just the thing I should give my life to.  Some of the offers contain just enough truth to sound right.  I\u2019m reminded of all the sports leagues that demand so much of a families&#8217; time.  There\u2019s a great deal of good happening in such activities, but, honestly, they aren&#8217;t worth committing one&#8217;s life to and they sure don&#8217;t deserve the status they\u2019re given in many families.  So what is it that\u2019s worthy of my focus?  I think the answer can be found by looking at life &#8220;backwards.&#8221;  When I\u2019m at the end of my life, when they\u2019re closing the lid on my coffin, what will matter?  I say it\u2019s my relationship with God.  Of course, other things will matter: family, friends, and how I\u2019ve impacted the world in my brief life.  However, eternity is, well, forever.  The goal of life has to be to prepare for forever.  With that in mind, I can read this proverb and better identify not only what truly matters, but what needs to be kept in its proper place as well.<br \/>\nTake Away: How are you doing in preparing for forever?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking at life \u201cbackwards\u201d Proverbs 4: Keep your eyes straight ahead; ignore all sideshow distractions.
