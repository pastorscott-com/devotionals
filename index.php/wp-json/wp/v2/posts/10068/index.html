Some people are involved in a civil lawsuit against each other. There\u2019s blatant immorality and the church has divided between the \u201cit\u2019s no big deal\u201d crowd and the \u201cit\u2019s sin\u201d crowd. Communion has been turned into a potluck and there\u2019s competition, not over who makes the best apple pie, but who gets to eat the most. Now, we see that people are fighting over gets to be \u201cfeatured\u201d in the worship services. One person starts praying, maybe in a prayer language, only to be shouted down by someone else who tries to pray better. One person has a \u201cmessage from God\u201d but is shouldered out of the way by someone being more spiritual about their \u201cmessage from God.\u201d The whole thing, in Paul\u2019s eyes, is infantile. The Apostle tries to walk a tightrope about it all. On one hand, he likes the idea that they\u2019re excited about having the Holy Spirit work in and through them. On the other hand, this disorganized, competition-filled approach to worship has to go. Paul lays down some rules intended to calm things down. When he\u2019s finished, their Spirit-language praying is, for practical purposes, removed from their worship services. He also rules out this business of talking over the top of one another with their competing \u201cwords from the Lord.\u201d He tells them to get organized and to come prepared rather than making up their worship service as it goes along. Singers, teachers, and preachers are supposed to come ready to do their part. Basically, he calls them to intentional, prepared, humble, courteous, organized worship. If a person can\u2019t handle that, they probably shouldn\u2019t be up front in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We want Spirit-filled worship but an indication of that isn\u2019t people competing to be the most spiritual.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worship service or a wrestling match? 1Corinthians 14: When you gather for worship, each one of you be prepared&#8230;.
