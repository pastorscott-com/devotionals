The whole thing is two and a half pages long and so small that translators decided not to divide it into chapters.  It\u2019s also unique because the prophecy of Obadiah is addressed to a nation other than Israel or Judah.  Obadiah is focused on their neighbor Edom.  Way back in the book of Genesis we find the story of the unlike twins, Jacob and Esau.  Here we find the expectant mother Rebekah experiencing such movement within her that she&#8217;s concerned about it.  The Lord tells her that she&#8217;s pregnant with twins and that the two boys will be the founders of two nations that will never get along.  In fact, they\u2019re getting a head start on the conflict by fighting while still in the womb.  No wonder Rebekah is both uncomfortable and concerned!  The first born is Esau who becomes the founder of Edom.  The younger is Jacob, who&#8217;s later called Israel.  In Obadiah we find ourselves hundreds of years down the road.  Israel is going through some devastating defeats while Edom watches from a safe distance.  Not only does Edom watch it all but they rejoice in what they see.  Their ancient enemy is being beaten up to the point of destruction.  God\u2019s man, Obadiah, turns his face toward this \u201cbrother\u201d of Israel and utters a prophecy of condemnation.  Edom and Israel may have a long history of disagreement but they&#8217;re still brothers who claim a common ancestry to Isaac.  Obadiah tells them that by just watching and even cheering what&#8217;s happening to Israel that they&#8217;ve made themselves party to all the evil that&#8217;s being done.  So to my surprise, even though I\u2019m reading a tiny, little-read book of the Old Testament, I realize I&#8217;m reading a real life version of the parable of the Good Samaritan.  In Obadiah\u2019s scathing words, I see what God thinks of people who fail to show compassion on others, even their enemies, in their time of need.<br \/>\nTake Away: So, who is my neighbor?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Another living parable Obadiah 1: You stood there and watched.
