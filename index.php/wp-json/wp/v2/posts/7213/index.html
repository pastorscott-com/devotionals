When I was a kid someone told me that Isaiah 14 describes the fall of Satan from the splendor of heaven.   I believed it and grew to adulthood assuming that all Christians thought that about this passage.  One day it dawned on me (and I probably had some help with that awakening) that this passage is about Babylon and its king.  The ruler of Babylon thinks he\u2019s bigger than God.  In fact, because of his nation\u2019s unequaled economic and military power and his unlimited authority over it all that he concludes that he, himself, is a god.  Isaiah prophesies that mighty Babylon is going to fall, and will fall in a very big way.  Now, this passage can be used to illustrate other things, but it really isn&#8217;t about anything aside from Babylon.  For instance the true-ism, &#8220;the bigger they come, the harder they fall&#8221; comes to mind.  Sometimes, even well-meaning people can mistakenly use Scripture in improper ways.  As God&#8217;s people we\u2019re to be people of truth, &#8220;rightly dividing the Word&#8221; even if that means we lose a handy proof text.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even well-meaning people can mistakenly use Scripture in improper ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Letting the Bible say what it says Isaiah 14: You said to yourself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll climb to heaven&#8230;instead of climbing up, you came down.&#8221; If you were raised in church as I was you\u2019ll identify with my observation that church folks develop a lot of folk theology.
