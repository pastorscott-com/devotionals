He\u2019s just finished feeding 4000 with just seven loaves of bread and he\u2019s about to give sight to a blind man. Meanwhile, his approach is angering the most religious people: the Pharisees. One of their number demands that Jesus do a miracle for him. Jesus refuses and promises that this man will never see one. You\u2019d think that Jesus and the Pharisees would be best friends. These religious leaders are knowledgeable, committed, and faithful. Many of their traits fit perfectly with Jesus\u2019 call that people take up their cross and follow him. However, instead of being some of the most exemplary disciples in the world they become the source of pain and division. They end up killing Jesus and then, after the resurrection, trying to kill the Church. Jesus, after his encounter with this specific Pharisee, warns his disciples about the danger of being contaminated by them. It\u2019s a very short journey from being radically in love with Jesus to being radically in love with one\u2019s beliefs about Jesus. It\u2019s all too easy to take one\u2019s eyes off him and to start looking around at other followers and deciding that they don\u2019t quite measure up. Just down the page from this incident, Peter first confesses that Jesus is the Messiah and is almost immediately told by the Lord that he\u2019s acting as Satan. Listen, it\u2019s easier than we think it is to be contaminated by the yeast of the Pharisees. Long after their branch of Judaism has dried up, their legacy of division lives on.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I want to love Jesus and avoid being too much in love with my opinions and beliefs about him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contamination Mark 8: Keep a sharp eye out for the contaminating yeast of the Pharisees.
