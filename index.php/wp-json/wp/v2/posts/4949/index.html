This isn\u2019t some national leader who does whatever is politically expedient and then tips his hat to the Almighty when it\u2019s convenient. Instead, this is a man who makes every decision based on his desire to please God. That\u2019s exactly how he approaches his religious life. If a decision has to do with worship he makes that decision prayerfully. He also prayerfully builds his life and Kingdom around carrying out God\u2019s Laws and Commandments. Judah is a blessed nation because it has a national leader who turns to God in everything he does. The result is that he\u2019s a \u201cgreat success\u201d and is commended by God as one who is \u201cgood, right, and true.\u201d I pray that the Lord will give my nation and all the nations of the earth such leadership. Also, in my much smaller leadership role, I desire to follow his excellent example.<br \/>\nTake Away: Leading, in itself, can be good or bad; depending on the direction the leader is going. A leader who leads people to righteousness is worth celebrating.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The very best at doing good 2 Chronicles 31: Everything he took up\u2026he did well in a spirit of prayerful worship.
