Now the adversary suggests that the reason for this is that Job is still playing the game of serving God because he\u2019s still getting something out of it; that is, his very life.  The stakes are incredibly high.  It\u2019s been proven that Job isn&#8217;t serving God because he gets wealth and possessions out of it.  Satan suggests that Job\u2019s hanging in there because he gets out of it life itself.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t hand his servant completely over to this accuser, but he does grant permission for Job to be afflicted physically.  What Satan does to Job is intended to be &#8220;a fate worse than death.&#8221;  This is all intended to answer the fundamental question of this book of the Bible: &#8220;Does Job serve God for nothing?&#8221;  Will Job continue in faithfulness when he\u2019s getting nothing out of it?  Will he serve God when all the blessings are turned to curses and his very life is a living death?  The remainder of this book answers this question.<br \/>\nTake Away: All else can be stripped away but nothing can rob us of our faith.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taking it to the next level Job 2: A human would do anything to save his life.
