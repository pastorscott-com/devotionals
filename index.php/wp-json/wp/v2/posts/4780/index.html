Because of that, Elisha has become a prime target. In fact, on this morning in the town of Dothan Elisha awakes to find the whole town surrounded by his enemies. To Elisha and his servant this is more than an inspirational Bible story: its life and death. His servant is mystified by Elisha&#8217;s calmness in the midst of his pending capture. That is, he\u2019s mystified until Elisha prays that this young servant will see what he sees. Surrounding the army that surrounds them is a &#8220;whole mountainside full of horses and chariots of fire.&#8221; With God&#8217;s army escorting him Elisha has nothing to fear from the army of Aram or anywhere else for that matter. God didn&#8217;t send the army of Aram that day, but he was prepared for it to come. Had Elisha been captured, well, that would have been an unwelcome thing for Elisha and company, but it could only happen if God allowed it to happen. Elisha might have been more aware of it than I am, but the Lord&#8217;s army is escorting me too. That doesn\u2019t mean that everything always works out just the way I want. Still, difficult days only come if he allows it, and in the end, I have the assurance that victory will be mine.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord walks through life with us, even when we aren\u2019t aware of his presence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you see what I see? 2Kings 6: Don&#8217;t worry about it &#8212; there are more on our side than on their side.
