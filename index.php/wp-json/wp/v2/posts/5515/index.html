The day being described is certainly coming but it hasn&#8217;t arrived yet.  Isaiah probably sees it as a time in their near future when Israel\u2019s restored and lives under the direct blessing of God.  Today, I read it as the promise of a blessed future when under the rule of the Messiah the peace promised at his First Coming is made real in the world.  One of the promised blessings is that God will answer our prayers before we can even voice them.  I&#8217;m reminded that I already have at least a taste of that.  There are times when I realize God has been at work in some concern of my life before I ever realized it was there.  What would have been a cry for God&#8217;s help becomes, instead, a word of praise for what the Lord did for me when I was ignorant of the need.  Since I&#8217;ve experienced things like this, I have just a faint vision of what it will be like in that blessed future.  Obviously, in that day I&#8217;ll spend a lot more time thanking and praising God and a lot less time earnestly asking for his help.  Since that kind of praying will be the norm, maybe I had better start practicing the praising part a bit more right now.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for answering our prayers \u2013 even before we\u2019ve known enough to pray them!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes God answers before I even ask Isaiah 65: Before they call out, I&#8217;ll answer.
