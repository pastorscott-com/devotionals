I have to remind myself of where I am and who it is giving this, seeming trite, advice.  I&#8217;m standing in the midst of the rubble that was Jerusalem.  Decaying bodies are in sight.  The man speaking is Jeremiah, the weeping prophet.  He&#8217;s the one saying, &#8220;Hang in there. You think this is the worst situation possible, but something good will rise even out of these ashes.&#8221;  The prophet knows that his words won&#8217;t make sense unless he adds the reason for his surprising optimism.  He continues: &#8220;Why? Because the Master won&#8217;t ever walk out and fail to return. He works severely, he also works tenderly.&#8221;  The worst isn&#8217;t the worst because God doesn&#8217;t walk out, never to return; and when he returns, it&#8217;s with tender compassion.  I may be traveling down an unwelcome road right now.  The darkness may seem complete because it appears God has forsaken me for good.  Jeremiah reminds me that it&#8217;s never that way.  Even Jeremiah, who has first-hand seen the &#8220;severity&#8221; of God, is absolutely convinced of the &#8220;tenderness&#8221; of God.  I need to sit at the feet of this man who can stand in the midst of devastation and declare his trust in the Master&#8217;s tender faithfulness.  These are deep, and necessary truths; especially in the painful days of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Trust in the Lord even in the hardest days of life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Surveying the devastation, with hope Lamentations 3: The &#8220;worst&#8221; is never the worst.
