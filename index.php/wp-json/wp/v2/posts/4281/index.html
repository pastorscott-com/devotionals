At times decades of ordinary events are skipped to jump to the next big event.  The first chapter of Numbers sets up the census and the coming description of other everyday duties of various servants.  The mountain top of the Ten Commands is history and the failure to enter Canaan lies ahead.  For now, they are learning the ropes of living day by day as God\u2019s people.  As we read the Bible it appears that the day to day part is minor, just a way to mark time between the big stuff.  In reality it\u2019s the opposite.  Most sentences used to describe life end with periods.  Only a few earn exclamation marks.  At this point, Moses\u2019 congregation earns high marks.  \u201cThey did it all.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: The real measure of our Christianity is how we handle the day-to-day, ordinary part of our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>They did it all Numbers 1: The People of Israel did everything that God commanded Moses.
