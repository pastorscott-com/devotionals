Jonah, in fact, preaches this sermon of condemnation and destruction in a spirit of victory and joy.  Jonah tells them God&#8217;s going to get them and his attitude is that he can hardly wait for that to happen.  I think it\u2019s that attitude rather than what he says that creates a \u201cscared straight\u201d result to his ministry.  Here\u2019s one of their sworn enemies boldly working his way through their city joyfully proclaiming that God&#8217;s about to destroy them all.  Jonah does such a good job of preaching his sermon that it has an undesired (for him) result: people listen!  I can\u2019t help but find it interesting that Jonah\u2019s the perfect man for this job, not because he shares God\u2019s compassion on this wicked city, but because he doesn\u2019t.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord has a way of picking the perfect (if unlikely) people for doing his work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The perfect man for the job Jonah 3: In forty days Nineveh will be smashed!
