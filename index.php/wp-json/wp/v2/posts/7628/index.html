This time, it won\u2019t be a famine of food or water, but a famine of God\u2019s Word.  Now, Amos isn\u2019t talking about a lack of leather bound Bibles.  He\u2019s talking about a time when God, Himself, goes silent.  When that happens, the prophet says, people will roam the land seeking a message from the Lord.  Amos ties this to the Judgment, a time when the God who has been available to them, reaching out to them, calling them to return withdraws the invitation.  Many have abused the prophets, even murdering them in an attempt to silence their voices.  Now, one of those prophets warns that they&#8217;re going to get their wish and that they won\u2019t like it when they do.  I\u2019m reminded today that there\u2019s a measure of God-hunger in every human being.  There are times when people long for the touch of God on their lives.  In their ignorance, they&#8217;ll substitute something else but whatever it is will fail to satisfy.  Realistically, why settle for a poor substitute when the Real Thing is available?  Happily, we aren\u2019t living in the day Amos describes.  Right this moment God is speaking, reaching out to all who&#8217;ll come.  This isn\u2019t an invitation to join a church.  Rather, it\u2019s an invitation to respond to the call of God to fellowship with him.<br \/>\nTake Away: Right this moment the Lord is speaking, reaching out to all who&#8217;ll come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God Hunger Amos 8: They\u2019ll go anywhere, listen to anyone, hoping to hear God\u2019s Word.
