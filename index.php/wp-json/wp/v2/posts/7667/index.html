These very people mistreat the poor, ignoring God\u2019s command to show compassion on them.  They might know how to have a rousing worship service but their day to day lives have nothing God-like in them.  Passages like this might be from the depths of the Old Testament and addressed to people who lived 2700 years ago but they ought to get our attention.  Think of it, God isn\u2019t impressed with our church services.  He doesn\u2019t care much about whether I raise my hands and shut my eyes and sing praise to him&#8230;well, at least he doesn\u2019t care unless I go out the door and treat people with a love and compassion that reflects his concern for them.  I know that it\u2019s possible for me to sell out to a \u201csocial religion\u201d and forget that God wants to have a personal relationship with me.  However, it\u2019s just as possible for me to think my religion is all about \u201cGod and me\u201d while forgetting it\u2019s just as much about \u201cme and thee.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: How we relate to one another is just as important to the Lord as how we relate to him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The measure of my religion Micah 2: Don\u2019t preach such stuff.
