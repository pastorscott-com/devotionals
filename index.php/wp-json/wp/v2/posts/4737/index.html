But very small&#8230;.<br \/>\nRevival has come to the famine, drought stricken land of Israel. The people have turned from Baal back to Jehovah God. Now Elijah, God&#8217;s man, turns his attention to the drought. He begins to pray for rain. Six times he stops praying and sends his servant to scan the horizon and six times there\u2019s a negative report. Elijah never gives up and continues calling on God to send rain. Then, on his seventh reconnaissance mission, the servant reports a very small cloud rising out over the sea. That\u2019s enough for Elijah. He stops praying and starts preparing for a rainstorm! This incident causes me to think about prayer. I wonder why it is that Elijah could pray one 30-second prayer resulting in fire falling from the sky, but then has to pray seven intense prayers to get rain to fall from the sky. My own prayer life, in much less spectacular ways, is like that. Some prayers are answered quickly and others, after years, are still unanswered. Then, this story reminds me of the power of prayer. Many years later James uses this incident as his example of what happens when just one man prays a fervent prayer. It\u2019s interesting that Elijah doesn&#8217;t contact everyone he knows (the country is filled with newly committed followers of God) to ask them to join him in praying for rain. In similar circumstances I might have posted the need on the Internet and fired up the church prayer chain. Instead, Elijah just shoulders the task and starts praying this important prayer. Finally, there\u2019s Elijah&#8217;s response to the cloud the &#8220;size of a man&#8217;s hand.&#8221; For me, that would be encouragement to hang in there and keep praying, but for him, it\u2019s answer enough. In this case, his ceasing prayer is more of an act of faith than his continuing in prayer. For those of us who are &#8220;prayer learners&#8221; this is instructive reading indeed.<br \/>\nTake Away: The prayer of a righteous person avails much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With Elijah in the school of prayer 1Kings 18: Oh yes, a cloud!
