It may be that she remembers her father&#8217;s &#8220;kingly demeanor&#8221; as she watches David playing the drum major role in leading the Ark into town. In her eyes, David comes up far short of her father at this point and she simply doesn&#8217;t understand why David would make such a spectacle of himself. Not only that, but, frankly, the outfit he\u2019s wearing doesn&#8217;t lend itself to such an animated, exuberant display and she tells him about it. David&#8217;s reply shows us his where his priorities lie. His joy &#8211; his dance &#8211; was energized by his love of God. If displaying that joyful love makes him look like a fool that\u2019s just fine with him. Here we see that spiritual leadership isn&#8217;t all about programs, plans, and meetings. Christian spiritual leaders are, first of all, followers. We follow the King of Kings, and it isn&#8217;t all business. As the Ark is brought into Jerusalem, David isn\u2019t afraid to rejoice openly and emotionally. As he points out to Michal, the maids she\u2019s worrying about know the real thing when they see it and his leadership is enhanced rather than lessened by his transparent joy in the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: Christian leadership is as much about leading people in enjoying the blessings of the Lord as it is about organization, vision, and plans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Follow the Leader 2Samuel 6: I&#8217;ll gladly look like a fool.
