Individual tribes and cities and also coalitions of previous enemies resist the onslaught of Joshua\u2019s army.  Now victory has come and war is over.  I know that the book of Joshua gives a &#8220;marching to victory&#8221; view of the Canaan Conquest while Judges paints a less pretty picture, but frankly, even the positive view of Joshua makes me cringe.  All the slaughter of entire peoples: men, women, and children &#8212; even, in some cases, animals. The Scriptures explain that it isn&#8217;t that God wants to give Canaan to the Israelites so he helps them exterminate those who live there.  Rather, it\u2019s that those who live there are so degenerate, so unholy, that God doesn&#8217;t want them or anything about them to contaminate the people he&#8217;s chosen. Still, I struggle with this because it seems so distant from &#8220;God is love.&#8221; I confess that sometimes God is a stranger to me.  Still, that which is wrong humanly speaking isn\u2019t necessarily wrong for the Creator.  The &#8220;Giver of Life&#8221; has full authority to be the &#8220;Taker of Life.&#8221;  Sometimes devotional lessons are hard to come by in passages like this, but here&#8217;s what I get today: there is an &#8220;other-ness,&#8221; a sobering, even a fear-generating side of the Lord.  I love him and I trust his character but I definitely don&#8217;t always understand who he is and why he does what he does.  I am glad God Almighty doesn&#8217;t need me to be his defender.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes we simply have to trust and believe even as we struggle to understand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes God is a stranger to me Joshua 11: It was God&#8217;s idea that they all would stubbornly fight the Israelites so he could put them under the holy curse without mercy.
