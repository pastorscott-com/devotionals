It takes him and his men three days to return to their base camp of Ziklag. When they arrive there all that&#8217;s left is smoldering ruins. Amalekite raiders have taken advantage of the fact that all warriors throughout the territory are massed at Aphek in preparation for a major battle. Ziklag and other area towns have been attacked and ransacked. The women and children have been carried away to be used as slaves or worse. David pursues them, driving his men to exhaustion. By the time he catches up to the Amalekites his forces are severely depleted with only 200 of the original 600 warriors still at his side. With God&#8217;s help, his band of 200 routs the much larger Amalekite force. They recover all the captives and a large bounty of goods taken, not only from Ziklag, but from the other towns as well. David insists that the spoils be equally shared with all, including those who were unable to fight. He also sends portions of the plunder to the towns of Judah, &#8220;A gift from the plunder of God&#8217;s enemies.&#8221; The coupled events of David being turned back from the battle at Aphek and his success against the Amalekites rescue David from the brink of personal destruction. In one case, he is stopped from becoming an enemy of Israel. In the other, he turns his trust back to God, and then acts in an honorable way in handling the plunder. Here we see God putting David back on track to lead Israel. Oh, the mighty hand of God, working through our stubbornness and human weakness. God works through a million and one circumstances to bring about his good purpose. It\u2019s that way with David and it\u2019s that way for us too.<br \/>\nTake Away: We don\u2019t always recognize it, but quite often the Lord works through the circumstances of our lives to bring about good.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Back from the brink 1 Samuel 30: A gift from the plunder of God&#8217;s enemies!
