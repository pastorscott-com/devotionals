All David wants to do is serve the Lord.  However, his enemies are making fun of him and taking advantage of every downturn in his life.  David asks the Lord to act on his behalf and foil the plans of his enemies and ruin the fun they\u2019re having at his expense.  When all is said and done, David wants to hear his friends say, &#8220;see, everything works together for good for David, the servant of God.&#8221;  Modern Christians are somewhat uncomfortable with David&#8217;s attitude toward his enemies.  We know that the One we follow taught us to turn the other cheek.  It\u2019s probably reasonable that we filter our reading of Psalms of complaint through the Sermon on the Mount.  Also, it\u2019s helpful to view David&#8217;s desires for his enemies in the broadest possible terms.  In other words, we may not join David in hoping God will strike down our enemies but we can join him in longing for the day when God sets all wrongs right.  God is love, and he is also just.  When we experience injustice not only in our lives, but in the lives of others it\u2019s acceptable for us to look forward to the time when God gives those bullies a punch in the nose!<br \/>\nTake Away: The day is, indeed, coming when the Lord will set every wrong right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The God of justice Psalm 35: Punch these bullies in the nose This Psalm is one of David&#8217;s Psalms of complaint.
