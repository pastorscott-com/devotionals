Beyond that, they\u2019ll live righteously, in sync with the Lord\u2019s purposes for them.  Because of that they&#8217;ll be put in charge, ruling even over their old enemies of Edom.  Their rule will not be that of a conquering nation, grinding their enemies into the ground, but a fair and just one, representative of their God who loves all human beings.  I find it interesting that the Apostle Paul reflects this concept in his second letter to Timothy.  Paul writes: \u201cIf we died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him.\u201d  At the very beginning of the Bible I see Adam and Eve who are placed in dominion over the earth.  In this passage from Obadiah, I find a promised brighter day in which God\u2019s people rule justly, throwing off the old animosities.  Then, I see Paul looking forward to the return of Christ and his righteous people ruling with him.  I don\u2019t claim to understand all that might include, but it sounds like God has more in store for his people than merely sitting on a cloud playing a harp.<br \/>\nTake Away: As a people of the Lord we\u2019re to reflect his love for all human beings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good news for people who don\u2019t find harp playing especially attractive Obadiah 1: A rule that honors God\u2019s kingdom.
