I\u2019m a pastor so I have a love and responsibility for the flock I shepherd. Beyond that, I\u2019m a denominational pastor so I have connections to maintain, meetings to attend, reports to do. I\u2019m okay with it all. I pastor a fine congregation and I\u2019m proud of my denominational ties. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Still, I have to be careful that programs and meetings and traditions don\u2019t own me. Sometimes, I need to be reminded that God doesn\u2019t exist to help me plan the fall program of the church and he isn\u2019t waiting on the denomination to tell him what\u2019s next. In fact, sometimes God sees trends and opportunities that aren\u2019t even on my radar screen. I need to be careful that my religious life isn\u2019t all about me performing as God sits in the audience wondering what I\u2019ll do next. I belong, not to my local congregation or the denomination or even the Church universal, but to the Lord. I\u2019m reminded of all that today in the words of the Apostle. What\u2019s God doing right now and how does he want me to be part of it? That\u2019s how the Church at large needs to operate. This is how the local church is to think. It\u2019s how I\u2019m to live my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Don\u2019t get so immersed in church culture that you fail to maintain contact with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wake up and smell the coffee!
