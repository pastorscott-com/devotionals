Here\u2019s a good man, a Gentile, who cares for the needy and who makes time to pray.  He\u2019s such a good man that he gets the attention of the Lord who wants to do something more in his life.  Then, miles away, we see another good man, a Jew, who loves the Lord and is a Spirit-filled follower of Jesus.  God\u2019s intention is to bring these two men together.  Connecting this Gentile and Jew at the level the Lord wants takes some doing involving an angelic visitation and a vision from God.  It works!  As Cornelius gathers a house full of expectant friends Peter arrives and soon begins telling them the story of Jesus.  The sermon has barely begun before it becomes unnecessary.  This gathering of people are already on the verge of faith and all it takes is a gentle nudge from Peter to open the way for the Holy Spirit to take command of the service and their lives.  How wonderful it is to experience such a move of God!  It\u2019s a blessing that both satisfies and causes hunger for more.  Once we have such an experience we\u2019re not likely to be fooled by some counterfeit!  <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Sometimes the Lord has prepared the way for revival and all it takes is one or two acts of obedience to put that revival into full motion.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Revival!
