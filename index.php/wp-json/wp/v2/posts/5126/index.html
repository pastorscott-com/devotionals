I find here, not only permission to speak to God frankly, from my heart, but I sense the whisper of the Holy Spirit reminding me that, if I do complain to God like that it had better be the real deal.

I need to get on with life; trusting God to see me through.  There\u2019s a big difference between my bringing my brokenness to God, honestly expressing my heart to him, and my just being a wimp who complains to God about every little setback in life.<br \/>\nTake Away: I can be real with God, in fact, I\u2019d better be.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being real with God Psalm 6: If you love me at all, get me out of here.
