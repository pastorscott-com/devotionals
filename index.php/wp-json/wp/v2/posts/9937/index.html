There\u2019s a clue just a few lines earlier.  These people want Jesus to prove himself to them, probably by performing some miracle.  Jesus dismisses them by saying that they\u2019re going to get proof alright, the powerful proof of life out of death when, as Jonah returned from the deep, he, himself, will return from the grave.  At that point Jesus turns his back on them and walks away.  Later he warns his disciples to beware of their \u201cyeast.\u201d  Those who bake bread know about yeast.  A little is worked into the dough so it will rise, becoming soft and tasty.  Jesus says that there\u2019s \u201cyeast\u201d that can work its way into every part of our lives, bringing not good results, but bad.  It\u2019s the insistence on God doing things our way, having to prove himself to us before we\u2019ll believe.  In the encounters of the Pharisees and Sadducees with Jesus there\u2019s always a tug of war concerning who\u2019s in charge and what Jesus has to do to satisfy them.  Jesus warns his disciples to not fall into that trap.  Before we know it this approach will work its way into our lives.  When God doesn\u2019t do things our way and in our time, we\u2019ll begin to doubt him and his goodness.  Later in this same passage, Peter first declares that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God.  Later on though, we see the yeast of the Pharisees when he argues against Jesus proceeding God\u2019s way, thinking he knows better.  If Peter, in basically the same conversation can go from a great statement of faith to one of \u201cmy way is better\u201d I\u2019d better take warning.  This yeast can work its way into my life before I even know it.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The idea that I always know just what God should do and how he should do it can sneak into my thinking and take root there.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lesson from the bakery Matthew 16: Keep a sharp eye out for Pharisee-Sadducee yeast.
