The story is just thrown in with the continued listing of who was the father of whom, but it does spark the imagination a bit and it feels like we\u2019re hearing about the old American west rather than about life centuries before Christ.  I wonder how the original readers reacted to this bit of information.  Did they hang their heads in shame or did they sheepishly grin at one another?  I think there\u2019s room for both reactions.  It\u2019s that way for us too.  We can\u2019t escape our connection to family.  Sometimes we\u2019re quite pleased with it and other times, well, not so much.  At one level, I\u2019m reminded that I\u2019m not above the ups and downs, successes and failures of life.  At another level, I don\u2019t need to take myself too seriously.  At least, so far as I know, I don\u2019t have any ancestors named \u201cUnlucky.\u201d  I\u2019m not as sure about the cattle-rustling though.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t take life too seriously \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s best to smile and move on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Family skeletons 1 Chronicles 7: Ezer and Elead [were] cattle-rustlers, killed on one of their raids.
