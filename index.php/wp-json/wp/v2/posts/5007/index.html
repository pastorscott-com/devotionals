It\u2019s these signers who draw my attention today. I doubt they ever imagined that almost 2500 years later I\u2019d be sitting here looking at their names: Mica, Bigvai, Hasshub; an entire page of names that mean only one thing to me: these are people who committed themselves to obey God. I don&#8217;t know what Adin or Beninu did for a living and I don&#8217;t know what became of their family tree. Hariph and Nebai might have built big businesses or designed impressive architecture but 2000+ years later that\u2019s all lost to me. It&#8217;s their relationship to God that still resonates across the centuries. If the Lord tarries for 2500 more years I will, no doubt, be forgotten too and that&#8217;s okay. I\u2019ll add my name to the only list that really matters and join these remembered people as a committed follower of the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: In the long run it\u2019s your relationship to the Lord that matters the most.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hard to pronounce names Nehemiah 10: The sealed document bore these signatures.
