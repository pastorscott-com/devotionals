A person can say and do a lot of wise things in their life, but one blunder can pretty much ruin it all.  I&#8217;ve seen that happen with presidents and pastors; with CEO&#8217;s and secretaries.  When my son got his first driver&#8217;s license I commented to him that many drivers only make one mistake in their lives, and it&#8217;s their last.  Car wrecks can be unforgiving.  It\u2019s true of other life situations too.  A man can be a good husband and father for 30 years and then get involved with someone for a brief fling that ruins all those years of faithfulness.  While I\u2019m a big believer in second chances and grace I also know that a few &#8220;dead flies&#8221; can ruin a lot of godly living.  Johnny Cash wasn&#8217;t singing a hymn when he sang, &#8220;I keep a close watch on this heart of mine&#8230;because you&#8217;re mine I walk the line&#8221; but his words do apply in that sense.  I don&#8217;t want a few &#8220;dead flies&#8221; to ruin a lifetime of faithfulness.<br \/>\nTake Away: Watch out for \u201cdead flies\u201d in your life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good theology from Johnny Cash Ecclesiastes 10: Dead flies in perfume make it stink, and a little foolishness decomposes much wisdom.
