Even though I can\u2019t explain the \u201chow\u201d I think I may know the \u201cwhy\u201d of the shining face.  When Moses comes down from the mountain the previous time, he finds that the people have cast off their faith.  This time, God wants there to be something about Moses that grabs their attention; something that these who are at the kindergarten level of understanding God can grasp.  Therefore, Moses\u2019 face reflects the transcendent holiness of God.  Even that\u2019s a bit too much for them, so they ask that Moses wear a veil as he reports what God is saying to him on the mountain.  Of course, preachers like me have been drawing from this story to remind people to \u201clet their face show it\u201d across the years and I do think God intends this.  God\u2019s people should have a \u201clook\u201d of inner peace, joy, hope, and, yes, holiness.  Like Moses, we spend time in the presence of the Almighty and everything about us reflects that.<br \/>\nTake Away: \u201cIf you\u2019re happy and you know it then your face will surely show it.\u201d \u2013 Children\u2019s Sunday School song<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shining Faces Exodus 34: He didn\u2019t know that the skin of his face glowed because he had been speaking with God.
