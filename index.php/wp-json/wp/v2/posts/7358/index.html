He told them to never live in permanent buildings and to drink no wine.  For generations his descendants have followed his orders.  Now, with the Babylonian army in the area, the Recabite community has moved into Jerusalem for safety.  The Lord gives Jeremiah an unusual order; he&#8217;s to meet with the Recabites and offer them some wine to drink.  As expected they refuse to drink it, politely explaining that their ancestor forbade it and through the many years since they\u2019ve followed his orders.  The Lord points out to Jeremiah that he has before him a group of people who are carefully following the commands of a mere human being, yet the nation as a whole is steadfastly refusing to follow the commands of God Almighty.  It&#8217;s clear that this passage really has nothing to do with whether or not we drink wine or even whether or not we pay attention to the directions left to us by our ancestors.  Obviously, we have some clear instructions in both the Old and New Testaments to pay attention to the orders of some people.  For instance, children are to obey their parents and citizens are to obey those in authority over them.  However the lesson here for Jeremiah and for us is that, if it&#8217;s reasonable for us to cooperate with mere human beings who have authority over us, it&#8217;s even more reasonable for us to cooperate with what God is doing in our lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: The only reasonable thing is to cooperate with the Lord as he works in our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lesson on obedience Jeremiah 35: The descendants&#8230;carried out to the letter what their ancestor commanded.
