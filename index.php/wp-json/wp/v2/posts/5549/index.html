He tells us, not only what God\u2019s saying, but also how Jeremiah feels about things.  Those feelings range from compassion to anger and from hope to despair.  At one point he says he\u2019s &#8220;heartsick&#8221; over the sins of his people and wonders if there&#8217;s a &#8220;balm in Gilead&#8221; that can be used to heal their brokenness.  He wishes he had the physical ability to weep the rivers of tears because of his sadness over their sin and the coming judgment.  Then, he switches to anger.  They\u2019re worthless people, not worth his effort.  He wishes he could just get away from them and let happen what\u2019s going to happen.  As I say, Jeremiah is a study in transparency and his feelings run the full range of human emotion.  I&#8217;m not wired the same as Jeremiah.  I don&#8217;t dip so low and I don&#8217;t soar as high.  Still, I can identify with him to some extent.  The truth is that, like Jeremiah, I can be filled with loving compassion for someone and be frustrated to death with them at the same time.  His desire to step away from these people for a while and head for the hills isn&#8217;t off the mark at all.  Even the best of people can only carry burdens for so long before a break is needed; a chance to reevaluate and get a fresh grip on things.  That &#8220;backwoods cabin&#8221; experience might actually be the &#8220;balm in Gilead&#8221; that will not only help Jeremiah bring healing to these broken people, but will also bring healing to his spirit as well.<br \/>\nTake Away: We must guard against getting so people-focused that we fail to be God-focused.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Heading for the hills Jeremiah 9: At times I wish I had a&#8230;backwoods cabin.
