Still others come with great reluctance; such as the death of a loved one who promised to be with us always.  Sometimes I make something that was never intended to be permanent into a centerpiece in my life.  When the time comes for it to be taken away it becomes, spiritually speaking, a surgery rather than a simple letting go.  Because of the temporary nature of this life, I must remember the truth of Isaiah&#8217;s words here.  There\u2019s only one place of absolute firm footing and that\u2019s on the solid rock of God.  He\u2019s the only One who never fails.  As I take my stand on the rock of his faithfulness everything else falls into its proper place.  I can weather betrayal because One vastly greater has not betrayed me.  I can survive some thoughtless, accidental failure and I can find hope even in genuine personal disasters because my hope isn\u2019t focused there in the first place.  Everything else comes and goes.  If I\u2019ve pinned my hopes and dreams on anything or anyone else, I\u2019ll become a sad, broken man.  The only stability I really have (and need) is in the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s only one place of absolute firm footing and that\u2019s on the solid rock of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the solid Rock I stand Isaiah 40: God doesn&#8217;t come and go.
