While it\u2019s true that they need to \u201cmove forward\u201d in response to what God is doing, it\u2019s still God who provides their deliverance.  They don\u2019t exactly \u201cstand still\u201d but they never raise a hand in their own defense.  It\u2019s God who provides the victory.  Now they\u2019re celebrating.  Moses leads the way with his song of victory: \u201cWho compares with you among gods, O God? Who compares with you in power, in holy majesty, in awesome praises, wonder-working God?\u201d  Moses turns their hearts in the right direction.  Even more than being about victory over the army of Egypt, this celebration is about God at work in their world.  Obviously that victory is no small thing.  Still, God\u2019s incomparable, powerful, majestic, wondrous work is the real reason to celebrate, whether it has to do with Pharaoh\u2019s army or not.  After all, this is God\u2019s story even more than theirs.  In my life there are many good things to celebrate, but beyond all that is the Reason behind the good things.  I\u2019m glad to join Moses in this praise and worship service.<br \/>\nTake Away: Celebrate the good things but don\u2019t forget to celebrate the Giver of those good things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praise and worship service Exodus 15: Who compares with you in power?
