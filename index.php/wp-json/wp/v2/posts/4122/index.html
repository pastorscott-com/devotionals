After years of misery God\u2019s plan unfolds and in a matter of hours an event greater than Joseph\u2019s highest hopes is realized.  This is so sweeping a change that even Joseph must have problems grasping it all.  Beyond that, there\u2019s a feeling of \u201crightness\u201d about it.  Joseph takes off his prison garments and puts on those of royalty and, well, they fit him perfectly.  He immediately begins to discharge his duties with authority.  You see, he was born for this moment.  It was a terrible thing when he was betrayed by, first his brothers, and then Mrs. Potiphar.  However, at the same time, the Lord used those events to prepare Joseph for what was coming.  Those years in jail were long and unwelcome, but the Lord used them to Joseph\u2019s benefit.  I haven\u2019t been as low and I\u2019ve never risen to the heights described in this story.  However, I\u2019ve found that the Lord is incredibly patient in accomplishing his purposes.  I\u2019ve also found that when it all comes together it all fits perfectly.  In fact, it works so well that, if I\u2019m not careful, I miss God\u2019s hand in it and chalk it up to being merely a natural flow of events.<br \/>\nTake away: God is incredibly patient in accomplishing his purposes, but the end result is just right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From Jailhouse to Penthouse Genesis 41: Joseph was in charge of the entire country of Egypt.
