Jesus came to usher in a new way. Those portions of the old way that were intended to survive did so, but the rest came crashing down as the superior new way was put into place on the first Easter Sunday morning. There was an earthquake at the tomb that morning but there was a much greater spiritual earthquake that day and the result was all good. All the \u201chistorical and religious junk\u201d was replaced with the \u201cunshakable essentials.\u201d All that to say that the coming of Jesus was and is a very big deal: the centerpiece of human history. In a much more minor way, but still important to me personally, is the spiritual earthquake that happens when I give my heart to Jesus. The result is some big changes in my life. As it was with the Old Testament Law, some things are worth keeping. They survive the earthquake, made clean and new by Christ. A lot of stuff has to go. In the case of such things, it may be a slow motion earthquake as the Holy Spirit goes to work in my life, dealing with different things as time passes. A lot of stuff, though, simply falls right then and there. Well, one thing in particular: my own self-righteousness. It can\u2019t survive the Christ-earthquake. From my point of view its good-riddance; self-will and some other things must yield to Jesus if he\u2019s to be Lord of my life. Most earthquakes are unwelcome, but this one: this transformational encounter with Jesus is the best thing that could ever happen to me.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: When Jesus comes into a life it\u2019s a very big deal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Transformational earthquakes Hebrews 12: One last shaking, from top to bottom, stem to stern.
