When war comes to Israel the Lord takes the initiative, sending word that he\u2019ll work on Israel&#8217;s side to bring victory. The reason is that the Lord wants Ahab, who\u2019s already seen fire fall and consume the sacrifice and altar when Elijah prayed, to finally come to believe in God. This is mercy and grace beyond imagination. God reaches out to one who\u2019s not only lost but is also stubbornly lost. Ahab isn&#8217;t going to respond, but it won&#8217;t be because the Lord isn&#8217;t giving him sufficient opportunity to do so.<br \/>\nTake Away: We serve the God of Second Chances \u2013 a fact proven repeatedly throughout human history.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Another display of God\u2019s grace 1Kings 20: And you&#8217;ll know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that I am God.
