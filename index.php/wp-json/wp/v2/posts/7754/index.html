They need to stop letting other nations be their primary influence and they need to start living as people who are going to face God. They\u2019ve lost their bearings and are now at the mercy of whatever fad happens to come along. For a little known, mostly ignored, minor book of the Bible, Zephaniah has pretty much nailed my society. My nation has lost its bearings. It doesn\u2019t want all those \u201cChristian hang ups\u201d but it can\u2019t decide what values are worth pursuing. Instead, we\u2019ve become a shallow people, more concerned about being politically correct than we are with being morally righteous. Zephaniah\u2019s warning of Judgment Day needs to be heard here and now. Otherwise, our story is likely to end like that of clueless Judah.<br \/>\nTake Away: Zephaniah\u2019s warning needs to be heard here and now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We need to make up our minds Zephaniah 2: You\u2019re a nation without a clue about what it wants.
