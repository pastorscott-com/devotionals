Like a child who spends all her money on candy and then doesn&#8217;t have lunch money, I tend to focus on things that might feel good at the time, but won&#8217;t satisfy in the long run.  My deafness is so great that even when someone shouts out the truth I can&#8217;t hear them.  Instead, I hear the cry of materialism and am driven more by mass marketing schemes than by God&#8217;s word.  All along, I think I &#8216;m being smart and that, in the long run, if I do it my way I&#8217;ll be a contented, happy person.  Through Isaiah, the Lord responds that I&#8217;d better pay attention and do things his way.  God sees things differently than I do.  For instance, he sees surrender as the way to victory and death as the way to life.  The &#8220;higher way&#8221; Isaiah mentions isn&#8217;t about God being smarter than I am.  That&#8217;s a given.  The higher thoughts of the Lord spoken of here are about how he wants me to live my life.  I must retune my ears to hear his voice above the silliness of the crowd and then, in obedience, I am to align my life with his ways rather than those of the world.<br \/>\nTake Away: It takes practice and self-discipline to learn to hear the voice of the Lord over the noise of life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hearing God Isaiah 55: I don&#8217;t think the way you think.
