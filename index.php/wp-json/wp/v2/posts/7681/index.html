In the face of such perilous times Micah might be tempted to run for the hills or at least withdraw from society.  As anyone knows, Micah isn\u2019t the only one who has faced difficult days.  Through the centuries godly men and women have gone through unbelievable hardship.  Often that hardship has been on a national or even worldwide scale.  At other times the hardship is close to home: a family or even personal struggle that fills our days with exhausting darkness.  In this passage, Micah is no \u201cPollyanna\u201d who insists everything\u2019s always \u201cjust fine.\u201d  However, he is a man of faith.  As tempting as it might be to run and get away from all the wrong and uncertainty he sees, Micah declares he\u2019s staying put.  Why?  It\u2019s because he wants a front row seat to God\u2019s redemption!  Today, we believers aren\u2019t blind to the problems of life.  When things take a downturn we become anxious like everyone else.  However, in it all there\u2019s a thread of optimism.  We believe God is still God and that he\u2019s working in and through it all.  The end result is salvation.  We want a front row seat when that happens!<br \/>\nTake Away: The people of the Lord are an optimistic people \u2013 and, for good reason!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sitting on the front row Micah 7: I\u2019m sticking around to see what God will do.
