His words in chapter 10 are that prayer, but it isn&#8217;t a very pious one.  Job, in his misery, cries out to God, demanding to know why his life has taken such a terrible turn.  He complains that, apparently, he\u2019s accidentally missed some step and is being punished for it even though he has no idea of why.  If this is how things are, Job decides, it would be better to never live at all.  Zophar, but not God, responds to this prayer of complaint.  He\u2019s scandalized; maybe backing away lest the bolt of lightning he\u2019s sure is coming doesn&#8217;t hit him too.  In his thinking bad things happen to us because we deserve it.  This is no time to complain to God, it\u2019s a time to repent and admit wrong doing so God will let up.  Listen, Job&#8217;s prayer is the right prayer here because it\u2019s his heart&#8217;s cry.  God doesn&#8217;t want to hear us pray little fake prayers that pretend things about ourselves and our relationship with him.  He\u2019d rather hear an honest prayer of complaint than a dishonest prayer of contrition.  It may be that we Christians have so narrowly defined how prayer should sound that we\u2019ve defused it of much of its power.<br \/>\nTake Away: A dishonest prayer is more posturing than it is praying.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not a very pious prayer Job 11: Should this kind of loose talk be permitted?
