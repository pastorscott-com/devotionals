It still tastes fine and supplies, apparently, the recommended daily dietary needs.  However, manna for breakfast, lunch, and supper seven days a week is boring.  In Egypt they had meat, cucumbers and melons, onions and garlic.  In the wilderness they have manna, manna, and more manna.  In their dietary frustration they complain to God\u2019s, man, Moses and for him this is the breaking moment. He\u2019s angry with the people and he\u2019s angry with God. In fact, he declares, if this is the way it has to be he would just as soon be dead.  Moses has been burning the candle at both ends and now the fire has met in the middle.  People, like Moses, who have performed admirably through the most difficult circumstances, hit the wall and suddenly some minor problem causes them to crash.  Know what?  I think it&#8217;s Moses&#8217; own fault. His father-in-law, Jethro, told him he couldn&#8217;t do it all alone back in Exodus 18 and a plan was set up at that time. After that Moses spent time on the mountain with God, the terrible golden calf incident and some other things happened. I don&#8217;t know this for sure, but it looks like the plan Jethro suggested has dropped by the way and Moses is back to being &#8220;the guy&#8221; for everything. If this is true the result is predictable: Moses finds himself drowning in responsibility. Leaders need to remember that no matter how skillfully they organize things in the beginning and no matter how high the quality of leadership that&#8217;s brought on board, that they must continue to hold the plan in shape. Otherwise, things will unravel, and, over time everything will once again be propped up against them.<br \/>\nTake Away: Skillful leadership includes recognizing, training, and empowering others.  It also includes the providing of constant maintenance. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Be quiet and eat your manna Numbers 11: I&#8217;ll take some of the Spirit that is on you and place it on them.
