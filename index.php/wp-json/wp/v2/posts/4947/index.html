The newly refurbished Temple and the eager and capable work of those who serve there make for an impressive and satisfying worship experience for all that come. When the big celebration ends, Hezekiah makes it a point to go to the Levites and commend them for their superb work. In this, I see Hezekiah not only leading in vision and agenda but in thanks and appreciation as well. Good leaders do that. I do note that Hezekiah calls their work \u201csuperb\u201d because that\u2019s what it is. He isn\u2019t some cheerleader who shouts out \u201cWe\u2019re number one\u201d when the team\u2019s behind by 30 points. I\u2019m reminded though that even when the work doesn\u2019t reach the superb level there\u2019s probably something positive that can be said. Once the leader establishes good will the way may be opened for some constructive comments on improving things next time. So, I see in this passage that leaders should lead in words and acts of appreciation for work well done. Also, I remember that while a leader isn\u2019t to give false praise that genuine support can lead the way to opportunities to help others grow in their service of the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: Good leaders know how to lead the way in showing appreciation for work well done.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The chief cheerleader 2 Chronicles 30: Hezekiah commended the Levites for the superb way in which they had led the people in the worship of God.
