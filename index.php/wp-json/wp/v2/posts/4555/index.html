He wants you to listen to him!<br \/>\nSaul\u2019s a failure in the eyes of God. His large army and military victories don&#8217;t impress the Lord. Now Saul blames the soldiers; something that doesn\u2019t wash with the Almighty. Then, he says he\u2019s going to sacrifice the animals in a worship service. Pitiful! Samuel has a word from the Lord for Saul. God isn&#8217;t interested in how many sacrifices Saul might make. Instead, he\u2019s interested in obedience. Saul said &#8220;no&#8221; to God, now God&#8217;s saying &#8220;no&#8221; to him. Saul will continue in power for some time to come, but, in reality, his leadership has come to a whimpering end. Oswald Chambers says that the greatest hindrance to our relationship to the Lord is the service we do for him. &#8220;Look at all I&#8217;m doing for God\u201d we declare, \u201cSurely he can&#8217;t ask more of me than that.&#8221; He can and he does. Listening, obedience, and relationship: these things define God&#8217;s intentions for me. The Lord doesn\u2019t put out a call for volunteer martyrs. He simply calls us to hear and obey. If that means sacrifice, fine. Otherwise, I listen to his voice and live my life in a relationship with him.<br \/>\nTake Away: We\u2019re called to a daily, genuine relationship with the Lord \u2013 that\u2019s what satisfies both us and him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Listening, obedience, relationship 1 Samuel 15: Do you think all God wants are sacrifices &#8212; empty rituals just for show?
