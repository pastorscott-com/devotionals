Apparently, he has some friends who like him and want to protect him.  As Jesus explodes in popularity they\u2019re concerned about him.  People are constantly crowding in, bringing their needs to him, and demanding his attention.  Jesus doesn\u2019t even have time to eat.  His friends decide that Jesus has gotten carried away by all that\u2019s happening.  If necessary, they\u2019ll act unilaterally to rescue Jesus from the crowds.  As far as I can tell nothing ever comes of it.  When the mother and brothers of Jesus show up he turns it into a teaching moment: \u201che went back to teaching.\u201d  On one hand, I see here that Jesus knows what he\u2019s doing and doesn\u2019t need me or anyone else to explain things to him.  On the other hand, though, I\u2019m taken with these unknown friends of Jesus.   In a day when everyone wants a piece of Jesus here\u2019s a group of people who only want to take care of him.  On this day, their conclusion is wrong, but I\u2019m impressed with their hearts.  I understand that I&#8217;m a needy person and that the greatest needs of my life can only be met by my Lord.  At the same time, I want to be his friend.  It\u2019s not that I think he needs me to protect him, but I do think he appreciates it if I just want to be in his presence; to enjoy just knowing him, no miracle required.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Am I a friend of Jesus?<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Friends of Jesus Mark 3: His friends heard what was going on and went to rescue him, by force if necessary.
