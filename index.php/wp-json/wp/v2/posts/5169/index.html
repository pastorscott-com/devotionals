He sees all that\u2019s happening and asks God, &#8220;How long will you let this go on?&#8221;  Then the song writer begins to answer his own question reminding us that surely the &#8220;Ear-Maker&#8221; hears what\u2019s being said and the &#8220;Eye-Maker&#8221; sees what\u2019s going on.  He states, &#8220;God will never walk away from his people.&#8221;  There are times in life when we\u2019re left with nothing but our trust in God&#8217;s love.  We believe that he hears our prayers, sees what\u2019s happening, and that he loves us with a never-ending love.  At times like that it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for us, on one hand, to proclaim, &#8220;I know it\u2019ll be okay because the Lord\u2019s on my side&#8221; while, on the other hand to cry out, &#8220;Lord, how much longer before you act on my behalf?&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: It doesn\u2019t offend the Lord when his people cry out to him in painful, dark days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trust in trial Psalm 94: God will never walk away from his people.
