Solomon is looking for people of depth, who have thought out the meaning of life and come to some conclusions.  Instead, he finds that most people stay in the shallow end of the pool, never considering much beyond their next meal.  The saddest thing, as far as he is concerned, is that it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.  The Creator created humans with the potential for greatness.

It\u2019s of great value to consider &#8220;why I am here and where I am going.&#8221;  The answer is the one we seem most intent on ignoring: &#8220;God.&#8221;  It\u2019s my connection to the divine that gives meaning to my life.  He not only made me, but he made me for a purpose.  When I live without recognizing that, I, in the words of Ecclesiastes, make &#8220;a mess of things.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s my connection to the divine that gives meaning to my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The purpose of life Ecclesiastes 7: God made men and women true and upright; we&#8217;re the ones who&#8217;ve made a mess of things.
