He\u2019s treated to a meal \u201cfit for a king\u201d that\u2019s intended to soften him up a bit. When Ahab thinks the time\u2019s right he suggests an alliance between Israel and Judah against Ramoth Gilead. Jehoshaphat is hesitant and suggests that they consult the Lord. The result is a pre-arranged prophetic display from some of Ahab\u2019s hand-picked prophets. Jehoshaphat knows what\u2019s going on and asks for a second opinion, this time from a real prophet of God. It\u2019s now that we meet Micaiah. I picture him as a little fireball of a fellow. In fact, his feistiness has already gotten him on the bad side of Ahab. Micaiah says this campaign will end in massive defeat, especially for Israel. When pressed on the matter he gives an imaginary scenario in which the Lord calls a meeting of his angelic advisors. The Lord wants their ideas of how to get Ahab to make the foolish decision to attack Ramoth Gilead. Finally, one angel says it won\u2019t be hard to do; he\u2019ll just get all of Ahab\u2019s paid prophets to lie to him! As you can imagine all these so called prophets don\u2019t take kindly to being called liars and pandemonium breaks out. Ahab has Micaiah thrown into jail and proceeds with his battle plans. It\u2019s his last battle. It\u2019s really not hard to find people who agree with us. Some folks really like us and think we can do about anything; they tell us to go for it. Others want to score points with us, or are afraid of us, or really don\u2019t care one way or another. The trick is to find people who know what they\u2019re talking about and who will risk telling us the truth, even if it\u2019s not what we want to hear. One person who will do that is worth a dozen of the other sort.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for good friends who tell us the truth in love.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finding good advisers 2 Chronicles 18: I\u2019ll get all the prophets to lie.
