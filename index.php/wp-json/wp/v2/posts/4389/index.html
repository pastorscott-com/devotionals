After all, he\u2019s led them for decades.  When he describes the blessing and the curse that&#8217;s set before them, he speaks with authority about what will happen.  They\u2019ll rebel against God and travel the road of the curse.  However, before Moses ever led this nation he followed God.  Through the years he\u2019s gotten to know the Almighty in ways that no other person of his generation has.  Even as Moses speaks with authority about failure, he speaks with equal authority about the grace of God.  This man of God is sure of this: when they turn back to God the Lord will be waiting to restore them.  Clearly, though, there\u2019s more than restoration here.  There\u2019s also transformation.  The ultimate fulfillment of this promise will come with the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost.   God, the Holy Spirit, will come to &#8220;cut away&#8221; that which handicaps people from fully loving the Lord.  In that work of grace, his people will be set free to love God with their whole being.  That\u2019s the way to really live.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord not only delivers people from the slavery of sin.  He also transforms them, changing them as deep as their very hearts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Heart surgery Deuteronomy 30: God will cut away the thick calluses on your heart\u2026freeing you to love God with your whole heart and soul and live, really live.
