Jeremiah calls such preaching &#8220;silly&#8221; and compares it to &#8220;straw&#8221; and not messages with real substance to them.  The Almighty reminds Jeremiah that when the message he preaches comes from the Lord that his words are like fire and &#8220;like a sledgehammer busting a rock.&#8221;  Two things come to mind here.  First, the Lord\u2019s displeased with preachers who focus on preaching entertaining, &#8220;what they want to hear&#8221; kinds of sermons.  Second, there&#8217;s a great need for sermons with the fire of God&#8217;s Word in them.  The first kind of sermon may get the preacher some compliments, but the second kind changes lives even as a sledgehammer changes a rock.  I thank God for preachers who have ministered God&#8217;s Word to me by bringing sermons that were God-inspired and God-empowered.  As a preacher myself, I don&#8217;t want to waste my ministry preaching &#8220;that&#8217;s nice, ho-hum&#8221; sermons.  Life is too short and opportunities are too few as it is.  Lord, let your fire ignite me, my sermons, and my listeners.<br \/>\nTake Away: There&#8217;s a great need for sermons with the fire of the word of the Lord in them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On fire Jeremiah 23: Isn&#8217;t my Message like fire?
