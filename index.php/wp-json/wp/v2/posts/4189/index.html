We don\u2019t need Charlton Heston and the magic of Hollywood to picture for us something spectacular happening.   Moses lifts his staff over the waters and the wind begins to blow, splitting the sea.  Then, after a night of waiting, the order is given to move out and over 600,000 people walk through that canyon of water, arriving safely on the other side.  The rest of their lives they&#8217;ll remember that experience, and well they should.  Big events, powerful evidences of God, don\u2019t happen every day, although this generation of Israelites is going to see way more than the rest of us.  I\u2019ve never seen the sea part or anything else that could be labeled \u201cspectacular.\u201d  However, I\u2019ve experienced some personal encounters with the Lord that have shaped my life.  No, I\u2019m not going to write about them here&#8230;they\u2019re my precious memories and not for public consumption.  However, like those Israelites of old, I warmly remember them and they have defined my life.  I don\u2019t need to see daily miracles to keep on believing but I\u2019m both thankful for and humbled by what I have seen and experienced.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our personal divine encounters may not be as spectacular as those in Scripture, but they define our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Defining moment Exodus 14: The Israelites walked right through the middle of the sea on dry ground.
