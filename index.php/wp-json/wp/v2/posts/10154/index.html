Frankly, he sees love as a cure-all, good for what ails us. Are we at odds with our brothers and sisters? Love will fix it. Are we struggling in understanding God\u2019s purpose for us and in grasping what Jesus has done for us? The key is love. When we see countless wrongs in the world and wonder what should be done about them John says the key component in our response is, you guessed it: love. The test of love proves or disproves our relationship to this God who is love. As his love is allowed into my life &#8212; as it\u2019s allowed to influence how I feel about, well, everything, its then that I know I\u2019m where God wants me. For many of us our greatest challenge is loving self. I, more than anyone else, know my faults and failures. It may be that I\u2019ve been verbally abused and have come to believe that what was said to me and about me is true. Possibly, deep in my psyche is the belief that if anyone really knew me they\u2019d see so many flaws that they\u2019d never love me. John tells me that that\u2019s simply untrue. The One who knows me best, who \u201cknows more about us than we do ourselves\u201d loves me with a powerful, sacrificial love. He thinks I\u2019m worth loving, worth dying for. As I accept his love for me, and his evaluation of me my relationship with myself changes. Once again, even as I struggle with my own self-esteem, the answer is love.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Love is the greatest.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good for what ails you 1John 3: For God is greater than our worried hearts.
