In spite of the compliments paid him by Tertullus, the lawyer for the Jewish leaders, Felix is a corrupt official who isn\u2019t above receiving bribes.  However, as Paul points out, Felix is in some ways best suited to hear the case.  He, himself, has a connection to the beliefs of the Jews because he\u2019s married to a Jewish wife named Drusilla.  He\u2019ll have a better grasp on some of the finer points of this case than others.  Tertullus contends that Paul is a ringleader of a group of Nazarene troublemakers.  Paul responds that this simply isn\u2019t true.  He hasn\u2019t even been in the country for several years and, at the Temple, he was minding his own business when others started the riot.  He adds that he makes it his practice to get along with both God and man.  Paul may have been at the center of a riot, but it wasn\u2019t his intention.  In fact, if he has it his way, he makes friends with everyone and focuses his energies on doing the right thing in all circumstances.  This leads me to a couple of thoughts.  First, Paul\u2019s goal should be my goal.  I\u2019m to \u201cdo my best to keep a clear conscience before God and my neighbors.\u201d  Christians aren\u2019t to be trouble makers.  Rather, we\u2019re to be good citizens and good neighbors.  Second, sometimes my best isn\u2019t going to be good enough.  Like Paul, I don\u2019t have to make trouble to get into trouble.  Sometimes trouble finds me.  When that happens to Paul, he stands his ground, shows proper respect, and trusts God to see him through the unwanted trouble.  His example is a pretty good example for me and for all those who live for the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Paul\u2019s the same guy who says, \u201cIf possible live at peace with all men.\u201d<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When trouble comes knocking Acts 24: I do my best to keep a clear conscience before God and my neighbors.
