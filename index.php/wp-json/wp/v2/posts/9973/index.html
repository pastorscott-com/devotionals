Jesus teaches, heals, and performs other miracles.  He\u2019s now traveling from place to place leading a large band of dedicated followers.  Of course, we see the disciples in that number but also several women are in his entourage.  These women, we\u2019re told, have stories of deliverance to tell.  They&#8217;re also major financial supporters of this ministry.  I think it\u2019s instructive to remember this as I read later on of Jesus telling the rich young ruler to give it all away and then follow.  Apparently, these women are, at the same time, wealthy and followers of Jesus.  They haven\u2019t been instructed to give it all away.  As I think about this I realize that the problem isn\u2019t how much money the young man has, but is, rather, how much the money has the young man.  These women who accompany Jesus use their resources for his work.  I think it\u2019s important to realize the balance that\u2019s required of us who follow the Lord.  Anything that comes between him and me needs to be cast off.  All else is to be laid at the feet of Jesus, a part of my living my life in him.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Having money isn\u2019t the big deal.
