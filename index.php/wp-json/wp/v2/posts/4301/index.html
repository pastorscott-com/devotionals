They saw all the same things their fellow explorers saw \u2013 both the good and the bad, yet while the others are convinced of sure failure, these two gents are trying to rally the troops into action. It isn&#8217;t that they\u2019ve decided that their army is superior to those of their foes.  Instead, they believe God has made certain promises to them, has brought them to this place, and now commands them to action.  You see, Joshua and Caleb aren&#8217;t especially brave.  In fact, they\u2019re fearful.  They\u2019re afraid, not of giants, but of rebelling against God.  Let&#8217;s see: giants over here, God over there.  If I\u2019m going displease one or the other, which should it be?   It\u2019s easy: I&#8217;d rather have God on my side against the giants than have giants on my side against God!<br \/>\nTake Away: If I\u2019m going to be fearful, let me be fearful of failing God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Faith talk Numbers 14: If God is pleased with us, he will lead us into the land\u2026just don&#8217;t rebel against God!\u2026Don&#8217;t be afraid of them.&#8221; Joshua and Caleb \u2013 I like these guys!
