It\u2019s a good question but I don\u2019t have a good answer. How much of what we do is at the core of Christianity? Is preaching or singing or receiving the offering at the core? The writer of Hebrews reminds me today that Christianity is all about Christ. That must be the same whether I\u2019m doing \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d church. In fact, if I make Christianity about church I\u2019ve already missed the boat. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not anti-church, in fact, I\u2019m all for it. However, for Christianity to be Christian it has to be absolutely focused on Jesus Christ. Even beyond that, it\u2019s a living, right-now, kind of focus. I\u2019m not looking at some old, dusty story or some tried and true belief system. I\u2019m looking to a person who\u2019s alive and well and with whom I have an up-to-date relationship. Only in such a relationship can I be a real Christian.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If we\u2019re not careful, we make Christianity about behavior or beliefs or church\u2026that\u2019s all mistaken. Christianity is about Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s all about Jesus Hebrews 3: Take a good hard look at Jesus.
