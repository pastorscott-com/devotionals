There they will die.<br \/>\nIt sounds unfair, doesn&#8217;t it?  God brings them out of Egypt, cares for them and leads them to the land he&#8217;s promised.  Then, when they\u2019re afraid of the giants of Canaan he dumps them.  It sounds unfair; but it isn\u2019t.   Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: he\u2019s giving them their own way.  They don&#8217;t want to listen to the pleading and encouraging word of Caleb and Joshua, they don&#8217;t want to follow the lead of Moses, and they don&#8217;t want to trust God.  So God says, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;  If they prefer to go back into the wilderness he\u2019ll let them go.  The result will be tragic, their bones scattered across the desert.  But if they insist, he\u2019ll let them have it their way.  Even here there\u2019s grace.  Manna will continue to fall, their clothes won\u2019t wear out, and God will still be their God.  The words quoted above aren\u2019t a death sentence.  Rather, they\u2019re a statement of reality.  The Lord will patiently wait until these decision-makers have died off and then give the same command and make the same offer to their children.  Passages like this define both free will and grace.  On one hand, God won\u2019t force us to obey him.  On the other, he\u2019ll never stop working in our lives, patiently calling us to himself and to his purposes for us.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord won\u2019t negate our free will, even for our own good.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grace abounds Numbers 14: In this wilderness they will come to their end.
