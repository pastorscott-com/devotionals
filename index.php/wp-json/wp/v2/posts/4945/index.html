If Hezekiah sees this whole event as his initiative I guess that\u2019s okay but actually God is, and always is, the \u201cFirst Mover.\u201d That\u2019s how it is for us too. Like the prodigal, we think to ourselves, \u201cI will arise and go to my Father,\u201d as though it\u2019s all our idea in the first place. And, just like it is in that story we arrive and find that the Father has been patiently waiting for us all along. To \u201cdecide to make a covenant\u201d is a good thing, an important decision. However, such a move is only possible by what John Wesley might describe as the \u201cgrace that goes before\u201d &#8212; God at work making it possible for us to come to that decision in the first place.<br \/>\nTake Away: Do you need to work some things out with God?
