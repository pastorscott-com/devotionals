It\u2019s a rough and tough place with lots of immorality. Paul comes preaching the Gospel of Jesus and many of these rowdy people become believers. For a year and a half (a long time for him) Paul stays, establishing them in the faith, teaching them what it means to be Christians. Now, he\u2019s moved on, but has received word that things aren\u2019t going very well in Corinth. One of the big problems is lack of unity. The Church of Corinth is splitting, not into two parts, but into several. In fact, if there\u2019s an opportunity for discord, they\u2019ve found it. Paul writes to them, saying, \u201cYou must get along with each other\u201d and then both reasons with them and shames them into unity. As I consider this passage the call of Jesus to his followers to be one even as he and his Father are one feels quite distant. I share the Apostle\u2019s concern as I look at the state of Christianity today. Sometimes \u201coneness\u201d seems out of reach and I wonder if Paul was writing to the Church today what he would say. There is, though, a silver lining in these opening words of 1 Corinthians. It\u2019s Paul\u2019s sunny, optimistic approach to all this. He describes the church as \u201ccleaned up by Jesus and set apart for a God filled life\u201d and reminds them that Jesus \u201cwill never give up on you.\u201d The Lord has already done a lot in their lives and Paul assures them that he\u2019s going to keep right on working. So, as I read these words today I confess that the state of Christianity today concerns me. At the same time I\u2019m infected by Paul\u2019s optimistic view of the Church. It\u2019s good to remember that God&#8217;s still at work today.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Lord is working inside the Church to make us one, and, as we cooperate with him, that\u2019s just what he\u2019s going to do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can\u2019t we all just get along? 1Corinthians 1: You must get along with each other.
