Some think Peter, but that\u2019s due to a particular theological agenda that isn\u2019t supported by the historical commentary of the book of Acts.  I do have the idea that some who heard Peter\u2019s great message on the Day of Pentecost were from Rome and were among the 3000 who became believers.  Perhaps they returned home and established Christianity in Rome.  If I understand the chronology right, as Paul writes this letter he\u2019s about three years from the events recorded in the closing chapters of Acts that will bring him to Rome.  In his other letters, he deals with specific concerns because he&#8217;s had personal contact with the churches.  When he writes to the church at Rome he takes a different approach.  The result is the finest book of theology ever written.  I don\u2019t know what the original readers thought of this letter but can only guess that they were as blown away by its depth and complexity as I am.  Happily for me, I\u2019m not committed to write a commentary on Romans, just some devotionals.  Humanity, Paul says, has ignored God resulting in a sort of downward spiral into more and more outrageous and destructive sin.  This book of theology describes how it is God has acted to remedy that situation.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If you like to read theology you can do no better than to commit yourself to becoming an expert on the book of Romans.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A theology book Romans 1: I write this letter to all the Christians in Rome, God\u2019s friends.
