Nothing quenches my thirst like a glass of cool, sparkling water.  Spiritually speaking, there\u2019s thirst-quenching water.  I can turn to a million substitutes that promise satisfaction, but they\u2019ll all let me down.  For some reason, though, I tend to turn to almost anything but the Real Thing.  No, I&#8217;m not talking about Coca-Cola!  Into the market place of life Isaiah comes, shouting out his message of hope to those who\u2019ve tried everything else yet are still dissatisfied with life.   His message reminds us that there\u2019s a genuine Source of satisfaction.  That Source isn&#8217;t a &#8220;thing.&#8221;  Rather, it\u2019s a &#8220;Person.&#8221;   Are you thirsty?  Come to the water.
