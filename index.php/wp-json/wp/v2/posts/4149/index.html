It\u2019s he who listens to their cries, remembers his promise to Abraham, sees their need, and understands their plight. And it\u2019s he who acts. Decades earlier, when Moses tried to take on the role of deliverer, things didn\u2019t work out. Now, God takes on that role. When the story of the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt begins, it starts with God in a burning bush and not Moses killing an Egyptian. Today, I want my story to be God\u2019s story. I\u2019d rather play a small part in his big story than have the leading role in a one man play.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s about my cooperating with God, not about him cooperating with me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s God\u2019s story Exodus 2: God listened\u2026God remembered\u2026God saw\u2026God understood.
