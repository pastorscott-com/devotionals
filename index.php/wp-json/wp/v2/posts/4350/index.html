God called him up to the mountain and in that place he had a powerful encounter with the Almighty.  The people of Israel, however, didn&#8217;t want that experience.  They saw the billowing smoke and the fire of God and were afraid.  Because of that, they preferred that Moses be their representative while they stayed safely in the valley.  I wonder how many blessings I miss because it is easier to stay where I am than it is to have a raw, fire-filled encounter with the Lord.  To be fair, there\u2019s more going on in my heart that just my wanting to stay comfortably unchanged.  After all, it\u2019s frightening to come face to face with God.  To get that close to God is to step into the fire.  Intellectually I know it\u2019s a good thing to meet God at that level.  In fact, I hunger for him in my spirit.  Still, I find myself hesitating to abandon myself to the fire of the Almighty.  But I must.  Otherwise, I condemn myself to a life that\u2019s a shadow of what it could be.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord invites you to step into the fire accept that invitation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Step into the fire Deuteronomy 5: You were afraid, remember, of the fire and wouldn&#8217;t climb the mountain.
