David isn&#8217;t ready to return home, but Saul isn&#8217;t pursuing him for the time being. Under the cease-fire David is thinking about more pressing needs, like food! In the vicinity there\u2019s a successful farmer who\u2019s shearing his sheep. This is more than just a farm chore. It\u2019s a big feast, a celebration of the success of the farm. David sends a few men to humbly ask the farmer to make a donation to his troops. The result is insult and denial. This infuriates David. There have been many times when he could have just taken some of Nabal&#8217;s sheep. Instead, his men have treated his shepherds with respect and kept their hands off of Nabal&#8217;s property. In his anger, David is on his way to raid Nabal&#8217;s farm and take revenge by taking his life. Meanwhile, Nabal&#8217;s wife, Abigail, hears what&#8217;s happened. She leaps to action by gathering a huge load of supplies and hurries out to meet David and his men. She humbly greets David and then presents a three-part argument as to why David shouldn\u2019t do what he intends to do. First, she\u2019s giving him a gift of many supplies. Second, her husband is a fool who\u2019s not worth his effort. (By the way, what kind of a parent names his son, &#8220;Fool&#8221; anyway? No doubt, Nabal is in great need of counseling!) Third and most importantly, she tells David that taking revenge is beneath him as a man of God. Isn\u2019t it interesting that David wouldn&#8217;t kill Saul who was seeking his life, but now, because he\u2019s insulted he\u2019s about to kill the fool, Nabal. Which is worse, having a powerful person try to put a spear through you or having a stupid person say a stupid thing to you? The trouble is that we\u2019re often like David here. The things that get us off track aren\u2019t when we deal with some major, obvious issue. When that happens we turn to God for his help, trusting in him. However, when it\u2019s a small thing, just an insult or a thoughtless driver who cuts us off in traffic &#8212; well, we\u2019ll just handle that ourselves; maybe teach them a lesson or two. We need people like Abigail around who can remind us to show some good sense in those &#8220;little things&#8221; that are such a danger to us.<br \/>\nTake Away: In some ways little things are more dangerous to us than the big things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The danger of little insults 1 Samuel 25: Blessed be your good sense!
