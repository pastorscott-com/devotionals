However, their difference isn\u2019t just for the sake of difference.  Rather, their uniqueness means something.   They\u2019re a unique people because they have a unique relationship with God.  While there\u2019s no question that God is worthy of worship, there\u2019s more to it than worship.  There\u2019s a connection between them and their God and that connection impacts everything about them.  Obviously, that includes moral behavior but it also impacts what they eat, how they cut their hair, and how they dress.   Even their calendar is built around their relationship with God.  It\u2019s because of how their relationship with God saturates their lives that their own children and people from the outside are perplexed and ask questions.  Moses tells them how to answer those questions: &#8220;We live this way because of God.  He has rescued us from our past and he has impacted everything about us.  Our lives are all about him.  Everything about us is about the Lord God.&#8221;  This sweeping relationship between God and people was unique in their world and it\u2019s unique in my world too.  For others, God (or the gods) has his place and when we enter his territory he is to be acknowledged.  Otherwise, we won\u2019t bother him if he doesn\u2019t bother us.  For a follower of God-Jehovah though, that approach never works.  Our lives are connected to him at every level.  We live as we live because of that relationship.  This is the message we pass on to our children.  In fact, it\u2019s the message we have for all who observe and question our approach to living.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord isn\u2019t distant and observing.  Instead, he\u2019s present and involved.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living as a people of God Deuteronomy 6: The next time your child asks you, &#8220;What do these requirements and regulations and rules that GOD, our God, has commanded mean?&#8221; The people of God are different than other peoples.
