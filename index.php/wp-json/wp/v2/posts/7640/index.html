After all, everybody has heard of Jonah and the \u201cwhale.\u201d   This is surely one of the top five stories of the Old Testament and people who&#8217;ve never read the Bible or attended church know about this \u201cfish story.\u201d   A few years ago I was teaching a church membership class and this story came up.  The teens in the class wanted to know if Christians have to believe as literally true stories like Noah and the Ark and Jonah and the \u201cwhale.\u201d  Had the question been asked by some fine fundamentalists I&#8217;ve known I would have thought I was being set up for the old trap that sounds something like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in a literal six day creation how can you believe in a literal resurrection of Jesus?\u201d   That question, by the way, ignores the clear teachings of the Bible which says, \u201cIf you confess with your mouth, \u2018Jesus is Lord,\u2019 and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d (Romans 10:9).  Note that Paul doesn\u2019t add, \u201cAlso, you have to believe every statement in the Old Testament is literal.\u201d  I\u2019m not required to believe in a literal six day Creation to be saved, but I do have to believe \u201cGod raised him from the dead.\u201d  Anyway, back to the teens in the membership class.  I told them that I believe the Lord created all things and that sending a big flood or making a big fish capable of doing what the book of Jonah says it did would be a simple thing for such a Creator.  However, the purpose of stores like this is to tell us something about God and ourselves and that it\u2019s a bigger mistake to read the story, believing every word while missing the lesson than it is to read the story and \u201cget it\u201d while doubting that it&#8217;s literal.  So, \u201cbig fish\u201d or not, I\u2019m supposed to come away from the Book of Jonah knowing more about God and his work in this world than I knew before.  That\u2019s still my goal as I start through this story once again.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Bible tells us the story of God and us.  It has no interest in answering every scientific question or providing for us fodder for religious debates.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The biggest fish story ever Jonah 1: One day long ago, God\u2019s Word came to Jonah.
