They\u2019re the writers of Scripture, introducing God to the world.  That\u2019s a place of great honor, but it\u2019s no guarantee of salvation.  Not only that, but these custodians of God\u2019s Word have, themselves, failed to live according to it.  Meanwhile, the outsiders have gone their own way.  Ignorant of God\u2019s commands, uninterested in his ways, they too have failed.  The result is \u201cthat we\u2019re sinners, every one of us, in the same sinking boat with everybody else.\u201d  So now what?  Those with the inside path to God haven\u2019t followed it and those on the outside haven\u2019t found it.  Hope for salvation has to come from, not within, but from outside of humanity.  Enter Jesus.  Through him the remedy for failure and sin is offered.  The Jews need him because they\u2019ve rejected what they knew God wanted.  The outsiders need him because they\u2019ve never started down God\u2019s path in the first place.  The generous provision of God is his making a way to life for all people, Jews and non-Jews alike.  The hope of salvation, then, is in this wonderful expression of God\u2019s grace to a lost human race.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: For those who know the law but haven\u2019t kept it and for those who never kept it because they never knew it, that is, for all of us, our only hope is God\u2019s grace.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grace extended to both insiders and outsiders Romans 3: Out of sheer generosity he put us in right standing with himself.
