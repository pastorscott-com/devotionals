It\u2019s a serious situation. Governor Zerubbabel feels a shred of hope as he sees prophet Haggai coming to meet him. Maybe the prophet has prevailed upon the Lord to send some rain. However, Haggai disappoints the governor. He&#8217;s heard from the Lord God and what he&#8217;s heard isn\u2019t about rain. God\u2019s man says that God&#8217;s displeased with them because they\u2019ve settled in to their homeland but haven\u2019t yet rebuilt the Temple. The Lord\u2019s complaint is that they\u2019ve found time to make their homes comfortable but they haven\u2019t found time to repair the Temple which lies in ruins. Now, this charge of God doesn\u2019t come the first day they arrive in Jerusalem. It\u2019s likely that Haggai arrived with that first group of 50,000 people who returned from exile around 16 years earlier. At that time there was considerable emphasis on rebuilding the Temple. However, other needs were pressing so the Temple project was suspended as the city of Jerusalem was secured, permanent homes were constructed, and agricultural concerns were addressed. Along the way people got used to seeing the Temple as it was. Now, a serious drought threatens their welfare. Haggai says the lack of rain is God\u2019s doing. The Lord&#8217;s getting their attention. There was a time for them to deal with the necessities of life but when the time came for them to take care of the Temple they put it off. This little book of our Old Testament is all about priorities. Apparently, the Lord didn\u2019t mind their focusing on dealing with housing and food needed for survival. However, their place of worship was also a necessity and the Lord expected that matter to become a priority to them when the time was right. Today, I\u2019m reminded that the priorities of my life are in constant flux. What I need to do at 8:00 in the morning gives way to what needs to be done at 11:00. Like a river, life flows along. Because of that, I have to keep up with the current priorities of my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: We have to keep up with the current priorities of our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Changing priorities Haggai 1: The people procrastinate.
