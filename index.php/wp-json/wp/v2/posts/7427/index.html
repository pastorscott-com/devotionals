The Lord takes him on a tour of the Temple, giving him a spiritual view of what&#8217;s actually going on there.  The sin is outrageous and disgusting.  Anyone who loves the Lord and worships him would be broken hearted to see their precious Temple desecrated in this way.  Then, Ezekiel sees a man on a mission.  He&#8217;s to walk the streets of Jerusalem, putting a mark on the foreheads of those who are distressed at the sin of their nation.  All others will be wiped out.  I find it interesting that in Revelation we find the &#8220;mark of the beast.&#8221;  In that case, it&#8217;s those who refuse the mark who are saved.  Here in Ezekiel, we see the reverse.  It is those with the mark who are spared from the judgment that comes.  Comparing the two &#8220;marks&#8221; ought to cause some who subscribe to a &#8220;Left Behind&#8221; brand theology to pause and consider!  I think of the mark of Ezekiel as the &#8220;mark of caring.&#8221;  You see, God cares about people and righteousness and holiness.  He&#8217;s always on the lookout for people who&#8217;ll join him in that concern.  If that fellow with the writing kit passed by my life today I wonder if I would receive that mark.<br \/>\nTake Away: The sin of our society should break our hearts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The mark of God\u2019s people Ezekiel 8: Don&#8217;t lay a hand on anyone with the mark.
