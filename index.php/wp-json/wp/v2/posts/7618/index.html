In fact, I\u2019ve even seen them lettered on homemade billboards erected along a few country highways, declaring (in King James language) \u201cPrepare to meet thy God!\u201d Frankly, I\u2019m not all that impressed with the sermons or the signs and I believe that John 3:16 has more life changing potential than do these words from the prophet Amos. Still, here they are, so I have to concede that there\u2019s a time and place for this message. So what is the time and place? According to Amos, God is tired of being ignored by his people. In an effort to get their attention the Lord has sent pestilence and disease, earthquakes and fires. Each time, when it seems that this is the \u201cbig one\u201d that will end it all, they, like a stick snatched from the fire, are brought back from the brink of disaster. Now, though, the clock has run out. God, Himself, is appearing and the God they&#8217;re meeting is angry with them. In the context of this message, \u201cprepare to meet your God\u201d is a statement of judgment and not hope. These words aren\u2019t intended to be a final warning. Instead, they&#8217;re a sentence of condemnation. When Amos says this, he isn\u2019t saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to start getting ready.\u201d Rather he&#8217;s saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too late, the Judge is here!\u201d Having said all that, obviously, I need to prepare now for my coming encounter with the Judge of the World. I don\u2019t want to arrive at that day and hear the words of judgment: \u201cPrepare to meet your God.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: Now is the time to prepare for the certain coming encounter with the Judge of the World.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before it\u2019s too late Amos 4: Prepare to meet your God!
