Ahaziah&#8217;s mother, Athaliah, takes her son&#8217;s place, not only on the throne but also as one committed to evil. Her first act is to kill anyone in her family who might contest her claim to the throne of Judah. It appears her plan has worked, and it would have, except for the bravery and quick action of Jehosheba who hides the infant Joash from his own grandmother&#8217;s murderous intention. Now, six years later, it\u2019s time to act. Intrigue abounds as plans are made to dethrone the pretender Athaliah and elevate Joash to his rightful place as boy king. As this takes place we\u2019re told that Athaliah is &#8220;oblivious&#8221; to it all. I think the Lord often works like this. Ordinary people and even the wicked pursue their goals, pressing on, thinking everything is working out as anticipated. Meanwhile, God is at work in the underground. Big things are coming and we\u2019re &#8220;oblivious&#8221; to it all. For Athaliah it means that her hijacking of the throne of Judah is soon coming to a bloody end. For followers of the Lord, it means that we\u2019d better keep our eyes on Jesus and be ready for &#8212; well, be ready for &#8220;whatever&#8221; comes next.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even when we can\u2019t see it, the Lord is at work, preparing for the next big thing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ready or not, here it comes 2Kings 11: Athaliah, oblivious to his existence, ruled the country.
