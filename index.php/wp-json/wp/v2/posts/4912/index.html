God is on our side; he\u2019s our leader.<br \/>\nAbijah, king of Judah is making a speech to the vast army of Jeroboam, king of Israel. From his hillside pulpit he reminds them that their nation has rejected God Jehovah. They\u2019ve kicked out his priests and named priests for their man made idols. As have national leaders for thousands of years, Abijah claims that God\u2019s on his side and, because of that, resistance is futile. Meanwhile, Jeroboam has his army pretending to politely listen. Actually, he has a large contingent sneaking around to the back of Abijah\u2019s forces. When they\u2019re in place, the army of Judah will be crushed. As the trap is sprung Abijah finds himself in a position to put his \u201cGod\u2019s on our side\u201d rhetoric to the test. The scripture says \u201cthey prayed desperately to God.\u201d Know what? He\u2019s right! The smaller army of Judah, in spite of their tactical disadvantage, routes the army of Jeroboam. This humiliating defeat spells the end of Jeroboam\u2019s reign. It also provides us yet another example of what God can do when we trust in him. Of course, if I want God to be on my side I need to pay attention to one little detail: I\u2019ve got to be on his side.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is faithful to his people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s on my side 2 Chronicles 13: Can\u2019t you see the obvious?
