It\u2019s the next phrase that gets my attention today, &#8220;It&#8217;s useless to rise early and go to bed late, and work your worried fingers to the bone.  Don&#8217;t you know he enjoys giving rest to those he loves?&#8221;  Since it\u2019s true that God is the One who builds things that last perhaps we can relax a bit.  Without the hand of God all that we accomplish by working 16 hours a day will be exhaustion.  It isn&#8217;t that we have nothing worthwhile to do.  The Lord graciously invites us to labor in his fields and be coworkers with him.  He goes with us out into our daily lives with an agenda of his own.  The reminder of this psalm is that our Master also enjoys giving us time off for rest and, especially, to enjoy our families.  As we\u2019ve heard many times, no one, at the end of life says, &#8220;I wish I\u2019d spent more time at the office and less with those I love.&#8221;  Remember, the direction given in this psalm is from the wisest man who ever lived!<br \/>\nTake Away: Life is a gift of God to be appreciated and enjoyed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Take it easy Psalm 127: Don&#8217;t you know he enjoys giving rest to those he loves?
