All along, the Lord had a superior way in mind. That better way started, not with rules and regulations, but with the Lord taking charge of salvation. His plan all along was to change people\u2019s hearts so that their religion would be less religion and more relationship. There were plenty of hints that this was coming. The revered prophets of old were much more relationship oriented than they were rules oriented. Jeremiah, who&#8217;s quoted in this passage, longed for a day when God\u2019s Law would be written inside a person rather than written on stone tablets. Their greatest king, David, was remembered, not as a man of rules but, instead, as a man after God\u2019s heart. The rules had their place, but now they\u2019ve been replaced by grace through Jesus Christ. Now, the old way is a museum exhibit. The new way is life, itself.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Through Christ\u2019s death we have abundant life \u2013 something rule keeping could never accomplish.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What God wanted all along Hebrews 8: God put the old plan on the shelf.
