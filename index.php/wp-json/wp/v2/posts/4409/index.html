On the seventh they marched around seven times and then with the blast of the trumpets and a shout of victory the walls fell and they charged in to win their first battle in the conquest of Canaan.  Who on earth came up with such a battle plan?  Well, it didn&#8217;t originate on earth at all.  This is God\u2019s plan.  Actually, speaking from an earthly point of view, it\u2019s not much of a plan at all.  Yet it\u2019s God&#8217;s way and that makes it the best way.  Have you ever noticed that that the Lord likes doing things in unique ways?  He uses shepherd boys to defeat giants, feeds people with bread that falls from heaven, and sets up a kingdom by going to a cross.  His ways don&#8217;t always make sense to me but I\u2019d better pay close attention to his direction.  All my plans and expectations must yield before an Almighty God who enjoys doing things his own way.  This is a source of frustration and delight to me.  I\u2019m frustrated when the Lord doesn\u2019t act in the way I assume he\u2019s going to act.  I\u2019m sure the phone is going to ring and the person I expect to call is going to offer me that job I\u2019ve been praying about.  The phone never rings, but then someone suggests a different route.  When God\u2019s in it, and if I\u2019m not so focused on things happening my way, my life\u2019s about to take a journey in a whole new, wonderful direction.  \u201cBut Lord, those are real walls around that city; let me suggest the best way to get past them.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s okay, my son, you\u2019re going to love what I\u2019ve got planned&#8230;listen to this&#8230;.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord loves using unexpected methods yielding spectacular results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is no way to win a battle, still&#8230;.
