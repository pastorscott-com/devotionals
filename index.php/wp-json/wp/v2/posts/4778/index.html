Naaman is the General of the Army of Aram, a nation that has a long and contentious relationship with Israel. He\u2019s a brave and capable warrior who\u2019s well respected in his homeland. Yet there\u2019s one terrible affliction that not only haunts him, but is probably killing him. Naaman has leprosy. When he hears that there\u2019s a man of God in Israel who heals people of this terrible disease he travels there, prepared to pay handsomely to be cured. To his dismay, Elisha doesn&#8217;t even meet him in person, but instead sends a mere servant with what sounds like a silly command: take seven baths in the muddy Jordan to be healed. Furious and humiliated, he turns on his heel to leave, but an old family servant gives the great general the best advice of his life. If Elisha had told him to do some great thing (for instance, pay a king&#8217;s ransom) to be healed, he\u2019s prepared to do that. Why not, then, do some simple thing like, &#8220;take a bath and be clean.&#8221; Naaman listens and the result is a miracle of God and a happy ending to the story. I think I need to pay careful attention to Naaman\u2019s story in my dealings with God. I\u2019m ready to do the great thing like following some demanding course of action or making some big sacrifice as I follow the Lord. While stuff like this is sometimes a part of being a disciple more often than not it\u2019s much less spectacular. &#8220;If you want to be my disciple follow me,&#8221; the Lord says. I respond, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it Lord \u2013 I\u2019ll serve you to the ends of the earth, I\u2019ll make great sacrifices for you, I\u2019ll be an example of total surrender to God.&#8221; The Lord says, &#8220;Tell you what, if I want you to do that stuff, I&#8217;ll tell you. For now, how about just walking with me?&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: What little thing is the Lord calling you to do today?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making it harder than it really is 2Kings 5: If the prophet had asked you to do something hard and heroic, wouldn&#8217;t you have done it?
