Often, his words are those of warning and condemnation.  At other times, his sermons contain wonderful words of hope and comfort.  That\u2019s the kind of message we hear from him in this passage.  Isaiah considers it an honor to be commissioned and empowered to preach good news to a people who are living as captives in Babylon.  His message is one of encouragement to the poor and heartbroken; to those who mourn and wilt under the burden they carry.  This message is so powerful that hundreds of years later Jesus selects Isaiah&#8217;s words to describe his own ministry.  The message of hope is Isaiah&#8217;s and then it\u2019s Jesus&#8217; and now, well, now it\u2019s mine.  The proclamation of God&#8217;s favor, his healing mercy and grace, isn\u2019t just Isaiah&#8217;s and, while it uniquely belongs to Jesus, I can lay claim on it too.  For those in Babylonian captivity and for those today that are bound by sin, this is good news.<br \/>\nTake Away: In Christ, we have Good News for people desperately in need of some Good News.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How wonderful to have a message of hope Isaiah 61: The Spirit of God, the Master, is on me because God anointed me.
