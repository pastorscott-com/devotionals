Paul has received word of all that\u2019s happening there and in this letter he takes on the most outrageous problems and promises to deal with other issues in person. Apparently, he\u2019s saved his biggest concern for last. Some in the church are beginning to doubt the Resurrection. He warns his readers stay away from such talk and launches into a reasoned defense of this core doctrine of Christianity. At the heart of it is simply this: if there\u2019s no resurrection, Jesus isn\u2019t resurrected and if Jesus isn\u2019t resurrected we\u2019re still in our sins. Resurrection is, for believers, vitally important. Our hope of salvation is in it and our hope for eternity rests on it. All the other problems at Corinth are minor in comparison to their wavering on this key point of faith. The Apostle says he wouldn\u2019t be out on the front lines taking the hits if he didn\u2019t believe in the resurrection. The resurrection defeats sin in our lives today and, in the end, it defeats our final enemy, Death. I\u2019m thankful for this reminder today. Life tends to wrap us up in an ever tightening grip. Even \u201cbeing a Christian\u201d gets loaded down with non-central stuff like committee meetings and various activities that are fine but not central. A reminder like this refocuses our priorities, taking us back to that which really matters.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christianity without the Resurrection is something other than Christianity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The heart of the matter 1Corinthians 15: It\u2019s resurrection, resurrection, always resurrection.
