As Elijah sits inside the mouth of the cave things start happening outside. There\u2019s a great wind, then an earthquake, and then a fire. We\u2019re told that God isn&#8217;t in these things. In other words, while they\u2019re sent by God he doesn\u2019t inhabit them. What the Lord has for Elijah is yet to come and it\u2019s only after the wind, earthquake, and fire that the Lord comes to Elijah in the gentle, quiet whisper. When Moses met God on this same mountain it was the same way. There was thunder and lightning and earthquakes followed by a face to face meeting with the Lord. We see this pattern repeated throughout the Bible. For instance, on the Day of Pentecost it won\u2019t be about the sound of wind, the tongues of fire, or other languages being spoken. Rather, it will be about God, the Holy Spirit, filling their lives with himself. As I see this repeated spiritual fact of life I\u2019m reminded to dial back my love of the spectacular and pay more attention to the \u201cgentle quiet whisper\u201d of God in my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Ultimately it\u2019s not the fireworks but is, instead, the personal presence of the Lord that counts in my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s easy to miss 1Kings 19: &#8230;a gentle and quiet whisper.
