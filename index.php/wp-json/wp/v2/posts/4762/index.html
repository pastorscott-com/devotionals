One is Enoch who, the Bible says, is \u201ctaken away&#8221; by God. The second is Elijah, who\u2019s taken up by a whirlwind into heaven, accompanied by a chariot and horses of fire. I\u2019ve read some interesting explanations of what\u2019s happening on that day including one effort to somehow make this into an alien abduction! While I don&#8217;t have the credentials to take this event on from a scholarly point of view it\u2019s clear to me that this entire passage is intended to convince me of the uniqueness and spiritual power of this man of God. On this day Elijah is overflowing with God&#8217;s power. Nothing like this has been seen on earth. Any understanding of this passage has to start with my recognizing that the intention of the writer is to convince me of the greatness of Elijah, the man of God. Ultimately though, this, and all Scripture, has to be read as a &#8220;God story.&#8221; God has done something in Elijah&#8217;s life. Earlier, I\u2019m given a sobering picture of his humanity. In that account he\u2019s a discouraged, exhausted, and fear-filled man. Now I see what the Lord has done for him and in him. He\u2019s been transformed into the spiritual dynamo I see in this passage. Now, as Elijah disappears into the sky, I don&#8217;t find myself at the end of anything. Instantly God&#8217;s power begins to flow through Elisha. This story continues because God continues to work.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord uses some people in wonderful, amazing ways but the story of his work continues long after their story has ended.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swing down sweet chariot stop, and let me ride 2Kings2: Elijah went up in a whirlwind to heaven.
