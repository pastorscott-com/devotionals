Things have calmed down a bit, and Moses warns everyone to not take the things of God lightly.  Holy things must be treated as such; with reverence.  If it\u2019s possible to treat uncommon things as common and thus bring condemnation, it is just as possible to treat common things as uncommon.  Our society specializes in that.

Silly things that are either simply common or worse are held up as shining objects of worship.  My society does that with sports, entertainment, and so-called success.  To treat the holy as common is sin that brings death.  The same can be said of treating common things as holy.<br \/>\nTake Away: Priorities are critically important in all of life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Holy things Leviticus 10: Distinguish between the holy and the common, between the ritually clean and unclean.
