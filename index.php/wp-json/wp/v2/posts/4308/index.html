Many resent Moses\u2019 assumption of authority and doubt his ability to lead them forward.  Resentment and doubt fester and some step forward to seize the moment.  They rally a collation to challenge Moses.  Not once, but twice the entire nation is moments away from eradication due to the wrath of the Almighty.  Moses calls for a contest of sorts.  Representatives of both sides will come to burn incense before the Lord.  God will choose who will lead his people.  The contest is a brief one.  No one can doubt the Lord\u2019s answer as the earth opens to swallow up the rebels.  The 250 who are offering incense to the Lord are struck dead by lightning.  If that isn\u2019t enough, the next day many throughout the camp complain, blaming Moses for all the death the previous day and the Lord responds by sending a plague that kills 14,700 people.  Clearly, the Lord is intent on establishing, once and for all, Moses as the leader of the Israelites.  Just as clear, is the realization that to this very day God expects his plans to be followed.  Without doubt, I\u2019m aware of the grace, mercy, patience and love the Lord has for us.  I need to also be aware that none of this means the Lord will just go along with me when I challenge his purposes in the world.  The result my rebellion may not be as dramatic as it was among these ancient Israelites but it will be just as serious.  Challenging God is always serious business.<br \/>\nTake Away: Never doubt it: the Lord expects us to be obedient to his will.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Serious business Numbers 16: Earth opened its mouth and in one gulp swallowed them down.
