David has accomplished much during his years as king of Israel.  Most notably he\u2019s unified Israel and made them &#8220;one nation under God.&#8221; David well remembers his predecessor, Saul.  He knows that Saul failed, not because he lacked the ability to lead, but because he turned away from God.  David&#8217;s charge to Solomon is to seek God and serve God with all his heart.  The good news is that when a person does that God is drawn to him.  I\u2019m glad today that God isn\u2019t hidden from me.  I don&#8217;t have to perform some elaborate dance to get to him.  In fact, he\u2019s already made the first move, providing me a way to himself, planting his grace in my heart before I\u2019ve ever thought of him.  When I start to come to God, I may think that I\u2019m starting some long and mysterious journey.  That\u2019s mistaken.  When I start to come to God, I think I\u2019m a \u201clong way off.\u201d   I take my first step only to discover, to my joy, that he\u2019s running to me even as the father ran to the prodigal.  I start out to seek God only to discover that he\u2019s already found me.<br \/>\nTake Away: If you\u2019re looking for God today, guess what?
