As the new Temple is dedicated it\u2019s an all-out, no expenses spared, all hands on deck worship mega-event. All the priests, wearing their rich garments, are on duty. The Levite choir sings to the top of its lungs while the orchestra provides the music. Over here, we see the trumpet players all enthusiastically sounding the call to worship. The worshipers are on their feet, glorifying God. Our finest worship events today can only hope to match this exciting, awe-filled event that is the dedication of the Temple. I\u2019ve been to some \u201cbiggies\u201d in my life like Nazarene General Assembly, Promise Keepers, and some wonderful camp meetings. While I know these aren\u2019t every Sunday events, I think they have a place in the worship life of God\u2019s people. There\u2019s something about combining excellent music, Spirit-filled preaching, and an awesome venue that stirs something deep inside of us. On one hand, there\u2019s much to be said for worshiping in the simplicity of a small church that just loves Jesus. I\u2019m all for it. Still, on the other hand, there\u2019s something to be gained by being part of an all-out, no-holds-barred, let\u2019s-go-for-it worship experience. There\u2019s room in my heart for both!<br \/>\nTake Away: God is worth it!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Those trumpets would have blown me away! 2 Chronicles 7: The priests were all on duty; the choir and orchestra of Levites&#8230;were all there&#8230;the priests blew trumpets.
