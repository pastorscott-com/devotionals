He has an entire division of wise men who are supposed to be experts in such things but he suspects that they&#8217;re all just carnival fortune tellers.  He knows that if he tells them his dream that they&#8217;ll make up an interpretation so he decides to really put them to the test.  Not only are they to interpret his dream, they&#8217;re to first tell him the dream, itself.  If they can do that he&#8217;ll know something supernatural is going on.  Nebuchadnezzar also has decided on an incentive plan for his wise men.  If they can&#8217;t tell him his dream he&#8217;ll kill them and their families.  If they do tell him, he&#8217;ll make them rich beyond their wildest dreams.  I can&#8217;t help but feel sorry for the fortunetellers who are in over their heads.  If the king told them his dream some would, no doubt, take it quite seriously and try to figure it out for him.  I&#8217;m also a bit frustrated with Nebuchadnezzar.  Here&#8217;s a man arrogant in his power.  The lives of all these men and their loved ones (including Daniel and his friends) are, in his eyes, disposable.  However, the Lord knows all of this and is using it for his own purposes.  Nebuchadnezzar has already been impressed with Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah as individuals.  Now, he&#8217;s going to find out about the God they serve.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord has ways of getting our attention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God has ways of getting our attention Daniel 2: If it please your majesty, tell us the dream.
