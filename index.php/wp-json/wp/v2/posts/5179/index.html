The events retold in the song happened hundreds of years in the past.  I can imagine the boys in the congregation grinning to one another during the verse about frogs in the bedroom of the king and flies filling the air.  That kind of imagery gets a boy&#8217;s attention!  Something else is happening as that psalm is sung.  Even as the boys think about flies and gnats and frogs they learn the story of God&#8217;s faithfulness, how he kept his promise and delivered his people from Egyptian slavery.  Thus that old story becomes their story.  Someday, they\u2019ll be the grow ups leading the worship and it will be their boys getting a kick out of the &#8220;frog story.&#8221;  Thus another generation takes ownership of the story of God.  We have the same opportunity.  Our children need to know of the faithfulness of God.  Stories that seem like the same old stuff to us are brand new to these little ones.  We owe it to them to tell it to them with the same conviction and wonder and celebration that it was told to us.  As we do that we connect them to the God who keeps his promises no matter what.<br \/>\nTake Away: Tell your children the story of God \u2013 tell it to them with conviction, wonder, and celebration \u2013 make it their story.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Passing the faith along Psalm 105: All because he remembered his Covenant.
