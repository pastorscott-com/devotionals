He leaves things in the hands of those who are to keep things organized and on track. However, Nehemiah&#8217;s heart is now in Jerusalem, so he once again asks Artaxerxes for permission to return there. When he arrives he\u2019s greeted with all kinds of bad news. One man has made a deal with one of the old enemies of the Jews, Tobiah, who he\u2019s allowed to use the Temple storerooms. The worship leaders were left unpaid and have had to leave the Temple to earn a living. The civic leaders have forgotten the Sabbath and are allowing that day to be a time when business as usual is being conducted. And, the Jews are again intermarrying with the idol worshiping people of the area. Nehemiah is &#8220;really angry&#8221; about all this and immediately goes to work repairing all this damage. I can&#8217;t help but wonder where all those declaration signers are, or even more, where Ezra the priest of God is at this time. That\u2019s a mystery the Bible doesn&#8217;t solve for us. However, the rest of it is pretty easy to understand. Nehemiah\u2019s a strong leader and when he leaves it creates a void that no one steps in to fill. One of the dynamics of the human race is that people, even well-meaning people, need leaders who not only cast a vision and oversee the pursuit of that vision, but, even after the fact, provide a compass that keeps things moving in the right direction. This doesn&#8217;t excuse those civic and other leaders for their failure, in fact, they should have provided some of that &#8220;God-centered&#8221; energy themselves. Reading this story is a real life lesson in leadership. It also reminds me of the importance of my staying focused, even when the biggest part of the project has already been done.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even when the biggest part of the work is done there remains the danger of losing focus and giving up gains that have been made.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A failure of leadership Nehemiah 13: I was angry, really angry.
