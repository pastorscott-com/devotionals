Each message follows a similar format: a description of Jesus as conqueror followed by a declaration that he sees what\u2019s happening in the churches. Then there\u2019s a word of encouragement followed by a word of correction followed by a call to response. Finally, there\u2019s a command to hear these words and respond by taking action. These churches are operating in some extreme circumstances with lots of opposition both inside and outside their number. There are enemies of Christ dressed up as apostles and there are those who are trying to blend Christianity with the local religion. As the church stands firm in the faith and stands up to these deceivers the Lord is pleased. If the church fails here it places itself in danger of being something other than Christian. The thing that stands out to me today is that the Lord sees all this. He wants the believers to know that they aren\u2019t operating out in the darkness apart from him. He also wants those who are dabbling in some of these beliefs and practices to know that he knows what they&#8217;re doing. It\u2019s good to remember that our labor for the Lord doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. As I faithfully serve him he takes note and wants to encourage me. It\u2019s nice when people tell me I\u2019m doing a good job. It makes me feel good, even appreciated. However, whether that happens or not there\u2019s One who sees what I\u2019ve done, where I live, and appreciates what I do in his name. Ultimately, that\u2019s the only thing that really matters.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Even if no one else sees the Lord sees.
