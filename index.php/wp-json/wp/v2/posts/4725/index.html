This spiritual giant storms onto the stage. The dreary story of one failure after another by the kings of Israel has given us a feeling of gathering darkness. Now, for the first time since Samuel\u2019s day we meet a powerful prophet of God. Elijah, God&#8217;s man, will change the dreary status quo. We have no record of his ancestry and his home town is nearly as obscure. King Ahab is feeling pretty secure in his sin when this unknown man appears to confront him with his spiritual failure. God\u2019s going to move directly into what Ahab believes is Baal&#8217;s territory. No more rain until Elijah, in the Name of the Lord, permits it. From this first public move and for the rest of his life, all eyes of Israel are going to be on Elijah. Then beyond his life he\u2019ll challenge and inspire generations. This is God at work, moving when it seems all is lost. I pray that God will raise up some &#8220;Elijahs&#8221; for our day too.<br \/>\nTake Away: There are times when the Lord moves in unmistakable, powerful ways. Let\u2019s pray we will see such a move in our society, today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s man storms onto the stage 1Kings 17: Elijah the Tishbite, from among the settlers of Gilead, confronted Ahab.
