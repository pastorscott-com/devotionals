Our Lord&#8217;s ministry will heal heartbroken people and pardon those held captive by sin.  Jesus doesn&#8217;t read the entire &#8220;year of the Lord&#8217;s favor&#8221; sermon from Isaiah, but in that sermon Isaiah continues proclaiming all the good things God is about to do for his people.  God is turning toward them in favor and there will be blessing upon blessing.  They\u2019ll be the recipients of the covenant God made with Abraham and with David and the whole world will know them as the people with the blessing.  At this point in the message Isaiah becomes so excited about what God\u2019s about to do that he declares that he\u2019s exploding in praise from deep in his soul.  Since Jesus picks these words to describe his ministry to the world we who follow him read this sermon of promises, not from only a historical point of view, but as though it\u2019s directed to us, personally.  In our lives we\u2019re set free from the dominion of sin and enjoy &#8220;the year of the Lord&#8217;s favor.&#8221;  Of course, we still deal with the ups and downs of life, but there&#8217;s a deep satisfaction that comes from being a people God has blessed.  Even as Isaiah is moved to explosive praise by this promise of the Lord, we too are filled to overflowing with praise and thanksgiving for what the Lord has done, and is doing, in us.<br \/>\nTake Away: How wonderful it is to be a people God has blessed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The people with the blessing Isaiah 61: I will sing for joy in God, explode in praise from deep in my soul!
