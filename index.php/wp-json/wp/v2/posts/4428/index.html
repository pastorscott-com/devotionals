Frankly, this isn&#8217;t an especially inspirational section of the book.  Now we are down to special cases: cities for the Levites and priests, and the Asylum-Cities.  These cities are important places indeed.  If a person has messed up and accidentally killed someone they can flee there and find mercy.  These cities of refuge are the only hope for some in need of a second chance.  I think there will always be a need for &#8220;cities of refuge.&#8221;   Simply put, people mess up.  Our world is filled with broken families, broken promises, and shattered dreams.  The need of the day is not for the Church to tell lost people how bad they are as it is to tell them that there&#8217;s still hope.  To some extent every church is to be a &#8220;city of refuge.&#8221;  God\u2019s people are to offer, in Christ, mercy and hope of restoration.  The Church is to be a city of refuge for hurting, broken people.<br \/>\nTake Away: Hurting people, including people who\u2019ve messed up, need hope and through Christ the Church offers that hope.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cities of refuge Joshua 20: A person shall escape for refuge to one of these cities.
