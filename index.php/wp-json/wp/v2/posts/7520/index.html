When Nebuchadnezzar has a disturbing dream it&#8217;s Daniel who comes through, not only with the interpretation of the dream, but the dream itself. This good man is always careful to give credit where credit is due, and he tells this pagan king that it&#8217;s his God who&#8217;s solved this mystery. &#8220;All the king&#8217;s horses and all the king&#8217;s men&#8221; can\u2019t do it, but God can and has. Daniel describes the dream and then he explains the meaning. The vexing mystery is unraveled for Nebuchadnezzar and he likes what he hears. I haven&#8217;t had any deep, meaningful dreams of late. However, life does have more than its share of mysteries. Who hasn&#8217;t asked, at some point, &#8220;why?&#8221; If you&#8217;ve never received one of those middle-of-the-night phone calls I&#8217;m happy for you but don&#8217;t think that call will never come. Sooner or later we all face some mystery of life. I&#8217;m glad today to be reminded that &#8220;there is a God in heaven who solves mysteries.&#8221; In this statement Daniel reveals his Source. God is the great Mystery Solver.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord can unravel the mysteries of our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mystery solver Daniel 2: There is a God in heaven who solves mysteries, and he has solved this one.
