Ish-Bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, is an incompetent leader and even his own men doubt him. In fact, David can finish it off any time he wants but for one thing: he continues to refuse to lay a hand on Saul&#8217;s descendants. Because of that, things drag on as Ish-Bosheth&#8217;s leadership of Israel slowly unravels on its own. One indication is that his general, Abner, secretly comes to David with an offer of peace. Apparently, David thinks that with Abner&#8217;s help the foregone conclusion of all this can end sooner and not later, and without his raising a hand against Saul&#8217;s son. It doesn\u2019t work out. David&#8217;s own general seizes the opportunity to get revenge for the death of his brother at Abner&#8217;s hand. Before Abner can act Joab kills him. As often happens in life, the greatest damage done is from &#8220;inside&#8221; rather than &#8220;outside.&#8221; In this case, David has one agenda and his general, Joab, has another. One of the challenges of leadership is not only knowing where one is going, but being sure that those we lead &#8212; or even better &#8212; those we empower to lead with us, share in that goal. Otherwise, they\u2019ll take the authority we\u2019ve given them and use it to pursue their own purposes.<br \/>\nTake Away: Real leaders don\u2019t try to do everything themselves. At the same time, though, it\u2019s important that those who work with us are on the same page as we are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Those we empower 2 Samuel 3: Make a deal with me, and I&#8217;ll bring the whole\u00a0country of Israel over to you.
