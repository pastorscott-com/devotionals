Then, to Simon\u2019s surprise this disgusting woman has managed to slip into the room.  Some servant will pay the price for that!  She ruins Simon\u2019s nice dinner party.  Not only is he scandalized that such a person would dare enter his very house, but she\u2019s dominating the moment.  With all this foolishness going on how can he properly impress his guests?  Jesus is obviously uncomfortable with her groveling at his feet, but he\u2019s clearly moved by her sorrow.  Maybe Jesus doesn\u2019t know her story?  Its then that Jesus speaks first as a teacher and then as a Savior.  This woman is overwhelmed by her sins.  Simon has missed the point because he doesn\u2019t see himself as a sinner.  Jesus then turns his attention to this poor, grieving woman and says the greatest words she\u2019s ever heard: \u201cI forgive your sins.\u201d  Simon hears blasphemy, she hears salvation.  In this story, do I best identify with Simon or with this miserable sinner?<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We tend to see ourselves as the \u201cgood people\u201d in Gospel stories, maybe, though, we\u2019re supposed to recognize ourselves as those who aren\u2019t so good.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A ruined dinner party Luke 7: I forgive your sins.
