Zechariah envisions a cleansing fountain where people can come to have their sins washed away, their lives made clean.  It was in 1772 that William Cowper penned a poem based on Zechariah\u2019s words.  Cowper had not enjoyed an easy life.  He suffered severe depression and had at one time attempted suicide.  Even after coming to Christ he struggled with depression.  At the same time, he wrote the words to many songs of faith.  His hymn based on the passage before us today is his best known.  Cowper realizes that the fountain Zechariah describes flows, not with cleansing water, but with the blood of Christ.  The fountain that makes \u201csoiled lives clean\u201d was opened at Calvary and the blood spilled there continues to wash away sins to this day.  \u201cThere is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Immanuel&#8217;s veins. And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for that cleansing fountain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is a fountain\u2026 Zechariah 13: A fountain will be opened&#8230;for washing away their sins.
