Two and a half months since they saw their enemies drown in the sea and since they celebrated their liberation.  Now they\u2019re out in the wilderness.  It\u2019s a difficult adjustment for the Israelites.  No more comforts of home as they transition to becoming a nomadic culture.  Change comes hard.  As they long for the meat and bread they ate in Egypt God graciously responds through Moses and Aaron that he will provide for them. These leaders relay God\u2019s message but they also include a word of warning concerning their complaining.  This journey is not in their hands.  Abraham has been dead for centuries, but they have yet to learn what he learned: the just shall live by faith.  The problem with complaining is that it places us outside the life of faith.  The God of the Red Sea is the God of the wilderness.  He\u2019s also the God of my everyday life. He expects me to place my faith in him in the days of miraculous victory and in the days of the wilderness as well.<br \/>\nTake Away: Complaining and faith are incompatible. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Simple trust Exodus 16: Who are we in all this?
