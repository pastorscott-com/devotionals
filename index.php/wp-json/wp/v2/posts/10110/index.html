Paul reminds them of what he told them about this topic while he was with them. The events surrounding the Second Coming will be too big to miss. Two huge, worldwide events will dominate all else: a great Apostasy and the rise of a very bad person who&#8217;ll pretend to be God Almighty. The spirit of this personification of evil is already evident in the world, so they already have an idea of what it will be like but when the real deal comes no one will be left wondering whether or not \u201cthis is it.\u201d The Apostle hurries to reassure them that everything\u2019s going to be okay. Just when it seems all is lost Jesus will appear and without any difficulty at all, will handle this bad guy. Paul tells his readers he\u2019s not all that concerned about this stuff. After all, he has bigger fish to fry. Just what is that? Why, it\u2019s putting his time and energy into thanking God for what he\u2019s doing and is going to do in their lives. So, what am I to do with \u201cend days\u201d concerns? I\u2019m to be aware that some bad things are coming to the world. I\u2019m to remember that Jesus is coming back and he\u2019ll handle it all with ease. Especially, I\u2019m to keep my eyes on the Lord and use my energies in living for him and in him and not let myself get worked up over stuff I barely understand in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I trust the Lord, not my knowledge about how everything will happen at the end of time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Antichrist and the last days 2Thessalonians 2: Don\u2019t let anyone shake you up or get you excited over some breathless report or rumored letter.
