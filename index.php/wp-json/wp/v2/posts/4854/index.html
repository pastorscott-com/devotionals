This group has an awesome leader and some especially outstanding men called the &#8220;Big Three.&#8221;  At one point David, who\u2019s on the run from Saul, comments that he\u2019d love a drink of water from the well at Bethlehem.  However, Bethlehem\u2019s under Philistine rule at the time.  That detail doesn&#8217;t stop the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; from fighting their way into Bethlehem, drawing water from the well there, and then withdrawing to bring it to David.  David\u2019s overwhelmed by this gift and refuses to drink it.  To him, this is a gift too precious to be received as a common thing so instead of drinking the water he pours it out as an offering to God.   I&#8217;ve never had anyone go to battle to bring me a drink of water but I\u2019ve had some people do some wonderful things for me.  When that happens I don&#8217;t want to treat their sacrifice as a common thing.  Some gifts that are intended for me are so valuable that I know they\u2019re too good for me.  When that happens, I can take the example of David, and make it an offering to the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: Kindnesses done to us ought to be appreciated.  They should also humble us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Water from the well 1 Chronicles 11: He refused to drink it.
