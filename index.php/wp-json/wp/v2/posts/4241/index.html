Moses couldn\u2019t enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud was upon it, and the Glory of God filled The Dwelling.<br \/>\nAs Moses finishes the work God gave him to do, God moves in.  Moses, through the God-given skills of the faithful workmen did what he could do.  Moses led the project, the people funded it, and gifted men acted in obedience in preparing this place of worship.  At this point they&#8217;ve done all that they can do, and the result is an impressive, lavish, and portable Worship Tent.  Of course, that isn\u2019t enough.  Unless something else happens all they have is a fancy museum.  Then God moves in.  He fills the place with his glory \u2013 with himself.  Now they really have a place of worship.  A couple of things come to mind here.  First, we do all we can do but it\u2019s never enough until God moves.  The best singing and preaching, the finest facility, the \u201cbest laid plans of mice and men\u201d fall short without God.  Second, we see an example of prevenient grace here.  God not only graciously moves in, doing the \u201cdivine side\u201d of this effort, but it was God who gave Moses the plans in the first place and enabled the people to do the \u201chuman side\u201d of this project.  It&#8217;s God who gifted the workmen.  It&#8217;s even God who worked things out so that the Egyptians gave this nation of slaves the very items needed for the building of the Tent of Meeting before they ever left Egypt.  Here\u2019s a picture of God working on both sides of the issue.  As always, in him we find grace, grace.<br \/>\nTake Away: We are recipients of grace all the way through.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grace, grace Exodus 40: \u2026the Glory of God filled The Dwelling.
