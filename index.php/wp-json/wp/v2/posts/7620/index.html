He was a friendly guy, a bit rough around the edges, using a few words I don\u2019t have in my vocabulary.  Then, he asked me what I did for a living.  I told him I was the pastor of a church.  Guess what happened?  Suddenly, he was a very faithful Christian man.  He told me about his church and his pastor and some words disappeared from the conversation.  Amos complains about people who claim God as their best friend but live very different lives than what the Lord demands.  The big issue to Amos is how the poor are treated.  He says that in his society \u201cjustice is a lost cause\u201d and people are \u201ckicking the poor when they\u2019re down.\u201d   God\u2019s man says that won\u2019t cut it.  I can\u2019t expect to get away with giving the Almighty lip service while ignoring his directions on how I&#8217;m to live.  Amos says, \u201cYou talk about God, the God-of-the-Angel-Armies, being your best friend.  Well, live like it, and maybe it will happen.\u201d  By, the way, I bought my car elsewhere.<br \/>\nTake Away: Live like it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Car shopping Amos 5: You talk about God&#8230;being your best friend.
