He describes false teachers, betrayal, wars, earthquakes, persecution, destruction, and other huge events.  Since I know that some of this already happened I\u2019m tempted to think I\u2019m clear of at least some of the things our Lord describes.  Then I run head long into Jesus\u2019 declaration that these words are for all of his followers.  He says that coming big events are obvious to those who pay attention even as the coming of summer is forecast by the budding of the trees.  Our Lord wants his followers to pay attention, not so much to specific things, like the rise of a false Messiah, but to the general flow of things.  After all, a person who watches just one tree as a predictor of summer might or might not see new leaves.  However, one who watches an entire forest will see proof abundant that things are changing.  On one hand, I think it\u2019s a mistake to list a few \u201csigns\u201d and focus in on just them.  After all, one might have misread the meaning of the passage in the first place.   However, if I pay attention I might just see that big things are brewing.  At that time, I don\u2019t have to be afraid, according to Jesus, but I do want to be sure I\u2019m ready for what I believe is coming.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Even if I miss some of the signs I\u2019ll be okay if I stay ready.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pay attention Luke 21: I\u2019m not just saying this for some future generation, but for this one, too.
