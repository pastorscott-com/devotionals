It appears like the morning dew, tasting like bread and honey.  Each morning the people literally \u201cpick up\u201d their breakfast.  Thus begins what will be an ongoing provision of the Lord that will continue for four decades.  Except for the Sabbath, each morning begins with their going out to receive this blessing of the Lord.

I\u2019m not against hearing folks share precious memories from days gone by, but as I watch these Israelites collecting their manna, I\u2019m reminded that if yesterday\u2019s blessing\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, well, I haven\u2019t got much.<br \/>\nTake Away: God\u2019s blessings are made new in our lives every day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stinking blessings Exodus 16: It got wormy and smelled bad.
