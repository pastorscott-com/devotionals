I\u2019ve seen people make bad choices.  If I ask them about it, they\u2019ll most often have someone or something to blame for what they\u2019re doing.  I&#8217;m not saying that everyone else is always innocent in some of these things but the bottom line is that people pretty much do what they want to do.  Sadly, even when I see what\u2019s going on I can&#8217;t force people to do the right thing.  As Ecclesiastes says, &#8220;no one can control the wind.&#8221;  Well, neither can one control the hearts of others.  The very fact that I love people, encourage them, and help them through their darkest hour means that I also give them the power to hurt me.  At some level I have to just let things go and protect my own heart.  As the writer says, &#8220;This is the way it is.&#8221;  When I\u2019ve done all I\u2019ve been allowed to do, and when my heart has been broken, I come to the place where I have to let go and entrust those I &#8220;can&#8217;t control&#8221; to the hands of a gracious God.  He\u2019s able to work through issues if he\u2019s given an opportunity, even after I\u2019ve been removed from the situation.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes we just have to walk away knowing that the more we try to help the worse we\u2019re making things.  Happily, the Lord never has to just walk away.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trying to lock up the wind Ecclesiastes 8: No one can control the wind or lock it in a box&#8230;as long as men and women have the power to hurt each other, this is the way it is.
