In fact, the name of the book can be understood to mean \u201ctalks\u201d or \u201cwords.\u201d  The occasion is the conclusion of his leadership (and life) and the pending entrance of God&#8217;s people into the Promised Land after 40 years in the wilderness.  Moses wants to remind them of their history so that they will take their story with them into the new land.  He also wants them to remember the mistakes of the past so that they won&#8217;t repeat them.  Most importantly, he wants them to remember the gracious faithfulness of God who has been with them and will continue to be their God.   It shouldn&#8217;t surprise us that this book has a lot of repeat material in it.  After all, Moses is preaching to remind them of these things.  Still, I see a somewhat different emphasis in this sermon as old stories are retold.  In the passage that draws my attention today Moses remembers how he organized the leadership.  It was his father-in-law who first suggested a division of leadership.  Then, later on, it appears the plan had not been carried through and God reminded Moses of this approach.  Now Moses remembers how overwhelmed he was as a solo leader.  Alone, he couldn&#8217;t carry their burdens.  This makes perfect sense.  A leader who tries to do it all will do a poor job of all of it.  It may make that leader feel important, even indispensable, but in the long run, his or her leadership will be a failed effort.  The solution is to select the right people to help, to empower them, to continue to enhance their abilities, to keep them connected to the primary leadership, and to always remember that the Lord is our ultimate Leader.  At 120 years of age and after 40 years of leadership we can be pretty sure Moses knows what he\u2019s talking about.<br \/>\nTake Away: Leadership doesn\u2019t mean doing everything.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Call to remember Deuteronomy 1: How can I carry, all by myself, your troubles and burdens and quarrels?
