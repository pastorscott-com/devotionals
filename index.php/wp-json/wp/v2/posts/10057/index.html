Their behavior, he says is \u201cinfantile\u201d and \u201cunscriptural\u201d and Paul is \u201ccompletely frustrated\u201d by them. The problem is their infighting. People are choosing sides and jockeying for position. They approach every situation from a \u201cme\u201d point of view, judging everything by what they\u2019ll get out of it and whether or not whatever it is in play will suit their tastes. Paul, their friend, tells them to stop acting like babies and get over themselves. He reminds them that it\u2019s all about Jesus, not them. It would be nice to think that the \u201cbaby problem\u201d is unique to Corinth but you and I both know it\u2019s not. It\u2019s human nature to measure everything by our own desires and tastes. On one hand, there\u2019s a place for that. After all, we bring unique experiences, knowledge, and insights to life. There\u2019s a place for us to express ourselves and let our preferences be known. I don\u2019t think the problem at Corinth is that some folks like the preaching of Apollos better than they like the preaching of Paul. The problem is that individuals selfishly insist on getting their own way and focus their energies on forming coalitions so they\u2019ll have more say than others. Paul tells them to cut it out and remember that the church isn\u2019t theirs in the first place. When I\u2019m manipulating things behind the scenes or openly demanding my rights I\u2019m dislodging Jesus from his place as the Head of the Church.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Like it or not, it\u2019s not all about me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stop acting like babies! 1 Corinthians 3: Are you really much different than a babe at the breast, content only when everything\u2019s going your way?
