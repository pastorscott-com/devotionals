Moses, God\u2019s representative, puts everything into place and now Aaron, the newly anointed high priest initiates the first sacrifices.  Before he presents the offerings of the people he has personal business to attend to.  He makes offerings of his own in preparation for serving the people.  The animals are killed and their blood is applied, a reflection of Precious Blood that will be shed many years in the future.  It\u2019s only after Aaron has done that that he turns his attention to the offerings of the people.  This passage speaks to me as the leader of my congregation.  I want to serve the people who are under my care but I must never forget that I have needs of my own.  If I fail to bring them to the Lord I\u2019m bound to fail my people.  In addition, this is not a one time effort.  In spite of what those outside the clergy think, we pastors stand in need of God\u2019s mercy, grace, and forgiveness on an ongoing basis.  Today, as I read about these events of long ago and regardless of the huge cultural and practical differences, I find myself identifying with these priests of old as they take care of their own business before they can serve their congregation.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we\u2019re to help others we need to deal with the needs of our own lives first.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Personal business Leviticus 9: Next Aaron presented the offerings of the people.
