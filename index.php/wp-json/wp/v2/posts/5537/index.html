We don&#8217;t know exactly how this word of the Lord came to him, but if it was in a dream, it was a nightmare and if it was a vision it was a very disturbing vision indeed.  He reports &#8220;I&#8217;m doubled up with cramps in my belly &#8212; a poker burns in my gut.&#8221;  I can&#8217;t say that Jeremiah is my favorite Hebrew prophet to read, but his humanity does draw me in.  Jeremiah didn&#8217;t want to be God&#8217;s spokesman in the first place.  However, he accepts the Lord&#8217;s appointment and his journey begins.  When he sees the coming destruction he isn&#8217;t a disconnected reporter.  Instead, he\u2019s part of the story.  As wave after wave of visions of destruction wash over him he\u2019s sick to his stomach.  He says to the Lord, &#8220;How long do I have to look at the warning flares, listen to the siren of danger?&#8221;  All he wants is out of this.  As a &#8220;proclaimer&#8221; of God&#8217;s Word in my generation I need some of his spirit.  Otherwise, I (and other Christians) sound hard and hateful and am easily rejected by the very people who must hear the message.  If I can interact with lost people without being moved by their plight something\u2019s wrong with me and I need a spiritual transfusion from this &#8220;weeping prophet.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Judgment, when it must be preached, must be preached with tears in our eyes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The weeping prophet Jeremiah 4: My insides are tearing me up.
