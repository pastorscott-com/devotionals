God caused the flood with the express purpose of purging the earth. The deaths are his doing, according to his plan. Now, the Giver of Life certainly has the authority to be the Taker of Life, so I have no argument at this point. However, the Almighty knows that unless he assures us otherwise every major disaster will cause people to fearfully look to heaven, wondering if this is the beginning of another purge. After all, it\u2019s not as though we don\u2019t deserve whatever God sends our way. In mercy the Lord promises that the Flood is a once-in-history event that will never be repeated. Because of this promise, we understand that other big disasters are simply the result of living in a world where bad things sometimes happen. The Lord doesn\u2019t want human beings fearing that this is \u201canother end of the world\u201d in the face of every hurricane or volcano eruption or earthquake. Instead, he wants us to live in fellowship with him, trusting him to be with us even in the disasters of life.<br \/>\nTake away: Don\u2019t treat every unwelcome event with a fresh round of self-doubt.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s promise Genesis 8: I&#8217;ll never again kill off everything living as I&#8217;ve just done.
