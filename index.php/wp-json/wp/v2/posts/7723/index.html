Will sin and evil win the day?  Nahum calls for calm as he declares good news for all those who love that which is good.  Nineveh appears to be on top of the world, but \u201cGod has something to say about all this.\u201d  The \u201ctop of the world\u201d position of that wicked city is a mere anthill in the eyes of God and when the Almighty acts, even that anthill will be \u201cmowed down flat.\u201d  Through the centuries there have been many times when it seemed this world was out of God\u2019s control and that the cause of righteousness was lost.  There have been times when God\u2019s people were speechless in the face of overwhelming sin.  That\u2019s okay.  You see, even when we\u2019re at a loss as to what to do or say, at just the right time, God will speak.  What appears to us to be overwhelming circumstances is a mere anthill to the Lord.  My mission in such times is, first, to keep trusting in him even when it seems evil has the upper hand and second, if he can use me, to be a part of God\u2019s remedy for a sin-sick world.<br \/>\nTake Away: At just the right time the Lord will speak.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At just the right time God will speak Nahum 1: And God has something to say about all this.
