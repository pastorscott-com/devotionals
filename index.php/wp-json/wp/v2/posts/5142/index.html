The Psalmist, though, has no such view of the world.  He sees God as a national God and his nation as a people of God.  In that relationship Israel, he says, is especially blessed.  Their military wins major battles, not because of their strength, but because God picks them to be his people and is watching over them.

No doubt, the great need of my nation is to come to God.  Still, there\u2019s a big difference between being a nation that chooses God and being a nation chosen by God.<br \/>\nTake Away: How blessed to be the people of the Lord!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How wonderful to be the people of God Psalm 33: Blessed is the country with God for God; blessed are the people he&#8217;s put in his will.
