These people walked close to God and, like a motor boat crossing a calm lake, leave a broad, expanding wake that influences people far beyond their experience and even their lifetimes. They\u2019ve influenced me. If not for them I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today. In fact, it would be easy for me to just focus on them and let them be my example and inspiration. If I do that that I\u2019ll be a better person. However, as potentially positive as that might be, I\u2019d be mistaken to do it. Elisha has known a great man, a man overflowing with the power of God. Now, though, that man is gone. Elijah&#8217;s disciples want to form a search party to try to find their master. Elisha, though, doesn&#8217;t seek Elijah. Instead, he seeks the God of Elijah. He knows that every good thing about Elijah was because of the God he served. He knows that the great need of his life isn\u2019t more of Elijah. Instead, it\u2019s more of the God of Elijah. Today, I thank God for those spiritual giants of my life. Their influence isn\u2019t taken for granted. However, it\u2019s not them that I need as I pursue spiritual excellence. No, it\u2019s not them; it\u2019s the God they served.<br \/>\nTake Away: Seek, not an \u201cElijah\u201d but, rather, the God of Elijah.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The God of Elijah 2Kings2: Now where is the God of Elijah?
