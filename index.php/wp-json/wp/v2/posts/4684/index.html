Under David, the nation is united and made secure. Now, under King Solomon Israel becomes an admired, respected nation. It is one thing to be feared and safe and secure and something more to be respected, viewed as a positive contributor to the world in general. That\u2019s what happens as Solomon leads Israel. Those who were enemies or at least subdued rivals now come to Israel in peace to sit at the feet of her wise king and to bring goods for trade. It has taken hundreds of years but this nation of slaves has received the inheritance promised to their ancestor Abraham. I know this is the high water mark for the Kingdom of Israel, but what an impressive mark it is. Because of the patience of power of the Almighty the impossible has happened and Abraham\u2019s journey from Ur to the Promised Land is complete. I know I\u2019m supposed to read this story and be impressed with Solomon, but today, I can\u2019t help but be impressed with his God; a God who makes unbelievable promises to unlikely people and then delivers on those promises. If I ever find myself doubting God, I need to step back from the close up snap shots of the Bible and get the big picture. It\u2019s pretty impressive.<br \/>\nTake Away: We too have huge, amazing promises from the Lord. How thrilling it is to remember that he always keeps his promises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The big picture 1Kings 4: People came from far and near to listen to the wisdom of Solomon.
