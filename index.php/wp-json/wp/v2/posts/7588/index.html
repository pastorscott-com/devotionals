Generations earlier, when the Lord delivered them from Egyptian slavery, he had plans for them.  They were going to be a force for righteousness on earth.  The Lord likens them to a strong farm animal that&#8217;s hitched up to the plow and can powerfully prepare the ground for planting.  This isn&#8217;t a put down.  In this culture any farmer who has such an animal is proud of it and cares for it.  The Lord says he saw such potential in that nation of slaves.  These people could change the earth for good as they spread righteousness everywhere.  Again, though, it isn&#8217;t going to work out.  Instead of planting righteousness and love, they spread wickedness, evil, and lies.  Not only do they fail to live up to their promise, they also have the audacity to work against God&#8217;s purpose rather than for it.  I&#8217;m reminded today that the Lord is well aware of my potential.  He knows what&#8217;s likely beyond me and he knows what I can do if I put my mind to it.  Of course, I never want to be guilty of taking God&#8217;s gifts and using them to work against him but I don&#8217;t even want to disappoint him.  I may not have the capability to change the world but surely I can help sow a little righteousness in the lives of those around me.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord knows what we can do in the work of his kingdom \u2013 and he expects us to do it by his grace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meeting expectations Hosea 10: Sow righteousness, reap love.
