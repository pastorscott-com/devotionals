Young women across the ages have longed for children and that desire is especially true in this age, 3000 years ago. In her society much of Hannah&#8217;s worth as a human being is dependent on her ability to have offspring. Even her good husband&#8217;s efforts to make her feel better about herself fail. On a trip to Shiloh everything comes to a head. In her misery Hannah pours out her heart to God at this place of worship. The Lord hears her prayer and answers, bringing not only relief to this good woman, but the beginning of restoration to Israel which has fallen far from God. I wish I understood why God hears and responds to Hannah&#8217;s prayer and not similar prayers prayed by people just as good and just as miserable as she. I know that God cares for hurting people and provides strength and comfort for them, and, sometimes he says &#8220;yes.&#8221; The rest of the time, we do the only thing we know to do: we trust him with that which we don&#8217;t understand.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for the times when the answer is \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 trust him in the times when the answer isn\u2019t the one we want.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When God says \u201cyes\u201d 1 Samuel 1: Crushed in soul, Hannah prayed to God and cried and cried &#8212; inconsolably.
