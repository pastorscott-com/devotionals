I\u2019m not the victim of circumstances and my problem isn\u2019t that I\u2019ve been mistaken about a few things.  Isaiah&#8217;s words point to the core problem: I\u2019m a sinner.  Beyond that, I\u2019m not just a sinner by action; rather I\u2019m a sinner by nature.  I\u2019m not a traveler who somehow wandered onto the wrong road; I\u2019m a rebel who rejected God&#8217;s way because I preferred mine instead.  Even when I try to do my best I\u2019m a failure at it.  The picture Isaiah paints is of a human race that\u2019s rebellious, stained, and lost.  Any possible hope must come from the outside.  That&#8217;s where God comes in.  This God specializes in mercy and hope.  He doesn&#8217;t patch up my messed up life; instead he makes it brand new.  Isaiah does a frightfully good job of describing my perilous condition, but he doesn&#8217;t leave me there.  As great as my sin is, Isaiah reminds me of the greater grace of the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord specializes in mercy and hope.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Greater grace Isaiah 64: We&#8217;re all sin-infected, sin-contaminated.
