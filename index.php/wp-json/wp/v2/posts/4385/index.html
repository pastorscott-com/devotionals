All the curses are related to the intentional breaking of the Laws of God.  Once I get past them, I find myself in showers of God\u2019s blessings.  Moses tells his people that when they live in an obedient relationship with their God that he delights in pouring good things into their lives, blessing them in the city and in the country; blessing their children, their land, and everything about them.  As a people of God they\u2019ll be the envy of all the peoples of the Earth.   I\u2019m happy to dwell here among the blessings because I know that Moses is about to turn things back around again and restate all these blessings as curses that will come if they turn their back on the Lord their God.  As a Christian I want to lay claim on all the blessings that are given to the ancient Israelites.   After all, Christians have been grafted into the vine that is God\u2019s people.  However, I\u2019ve concluded that I need to bridle in my enthusiasm at this point.  While I\u2019m sure God wants to bless his people I also have the balance of the Bible to read.  Being a devoted follower of God can, at times land me, covered with sores, in an ash heap or I might find myself in prison asking my friends to be sure to send me an overcoat before winter comes.  My conclusion is that God does bless his people (even those of us who have merely been grafted in).  He blesses us with his presence in our lives and sometimes in big, unbelievable, material ways.  I also conclude that these \u201chere and now\u201d blessings are only the tip of the iceberg of God\u2019s good intentions for us.  Ask any believer a million years from now about God\u2019s blessings and I think you\u2019ll hear a list that makes this one from Moses sound rather minor in comparison.<br \/>\nTake Away: The greatest blessing is God\u2019s presence in my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bless you Deuteronomy 28: God\u2019s blessing in your coming in, God\u2019s blessing in your going out.
