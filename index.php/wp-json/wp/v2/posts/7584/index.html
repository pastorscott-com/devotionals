Please keep an eye out for our blue light specials, you may find a very nice accessory to your faith for a low price.&#8221;  You head over to the New Age aisle.  Maybe a new crystal will help you pray better.  The Politically Correct section has some interesting items, some of that &#8220;what works for you may not work for me&#8221; might come in handy when dealing with some of the more narrow people you know.  The Hedonism section makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable but you can&#8217;t resist some of the &#8220;it can&#8217;t be all that bad if it feels right.&#8221;  And then you head over to the staples section.  After all, when all else fails you might just want some help from God Almighty.  At the checkout counter the salesperson asks if you found everything you wanted.  You answer &#8220;yes&#8221; but you think, &#8220;I&#8217;ll probably be back in here before long, somehow this stuff doesn&#8217;t seem to last like it should.&#8221;  As you check out, you can&#8217;t find the last item.  That&#8217;s happened before.  Everything else is there though; you&#8217;ll just have to make it without God.  Anyway, your religion is no one&#8217;s business but your own.  Right?<br \/>\nTake Away: He\u2019ll either be Lord of all or he won\u2019t be Lord at all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shopping for religion Hosea 7: They turn&#8230;here, then there, like a weather vane. &#8220;Welcome to WorshipMart, your one stop shop for religion.
