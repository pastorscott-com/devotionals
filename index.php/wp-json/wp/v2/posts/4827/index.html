He assumes the throne at just 12 years of age and rules Judah for 55 years. His record as king is that of total failure. All the reforms of his father are reversed. He\u2019s as committed to sin as his father was to righteousness. Over time he moves heathen idol worship right into the Temple of God. The result, according to the Bible, is that, &#8220;God was angry.&#8221; Now, decades after the fall of Israel God says he is sending the same, and worse, upon Judah. He\u2019s put up with their evil long enough. Still, in spite of the dire words of doom, the Almighty does not act, at least not yet. Manasseh finishes his life and is buried in peace. His son Amon doesn&#8217;t fare as well and is assassinated within two years of assuming the throne. In these accounts I\u2019m overwhelmed by the patience of mercy of God. Even when he&#8217;s &#8220;fed up&#8221; he waits a bit longer. That doesn&#8217;t mean that I can assume that God will always give me one more chance but it does mean that God&#8217;s patience is beyond my comprehension. In each generation he reaches out with a new and old message of hope. Even as the door of his mercy is closing he extends a final ray of light, one last opportunity to receive that light. This is what sometimes happens on a deathbed where a merciful God gives a person who has rejected him again and again one last opportunity. It works in lives that are, so far as the world is concerned, ruined beyond repair. Even as the darkness descends, there&#8217;s one last glimmer of hope for the one who will reach out and grasp it. And it works for people who are reading the Internet desiring some word of hope when they stumble upon a mostly unread blog.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The last ray of light 2Kings 21: And God was angry.
