He isn\u2019t a member of the royal family or priesthood and he doesn\u2019t have any famous relatives.  He describes himself as \u201cone of the shepherds\u201d of an unimportant town.  Amos numbers himself with the poor and unprivileged people of his society.   That standing flavors his entire ministry.  When he speaks of poor people being mistreated he does so as one who has experienced that mistreatment.   In about 40 years Israel will fall, rejected by God and defeated by her enemies.  One of the reasons for that fall is that God\u2019s people have separated themselves from the compassion of God to their poor.  The book of Amos is an important book for people of all periods of history because, as Jesus said, \u201cthe poor you will always have among you.\u201d  How does God expect a prosperous nation to treat its poor?  How does he expect we who live in comfortable, secure homes to treat those in our community who live in want?  Finally, what if we fail at this point?  Amos gives us a first-hand response to these questions.<br \/>\nTake Away: As a people of the Lord we can never separate ourselves from his compassion on the poor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just one of the shepherds Amos 1: The Message of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa.
