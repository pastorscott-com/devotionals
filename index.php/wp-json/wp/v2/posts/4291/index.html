Banners are flying, the Ark of the Covenant is leading the way, and the Pillar of Cloud is overhead.  It\u2019s time for the Israelites break camp.  Hundreds of thousands of people with all their possessions move forward with precision and purpose.  In just a few months this nation of slaves has been transformed into an organized, decisive people of God.  During the organizational process, Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses has kept company with the Israelites.  Now, as they prepare to break camp he tells Moses that he\u2019s going to leave for home.  He\u2019s not an Israelite and his family and neighbors are elsewhere.  Moses, though, encourages him to cast his lot with God\u2019s people.  For one thing Hobab is an outdoorsman, familiar with this territory to the east of Egypt.  His expertise will come in handy in the days to come.  For another, he\u2019s welcome to share in the blessing of these descendants of Abraham.  If he stays, Moses promises, he\u2019ll get a part of the blessing God has for them.  Today, I\u2019m drawn to this good man who, before we ever hear of the righteous Cornelius of the book of Acts, or follow Paul and Silas on that first missionary journey, connects himself to the people of God.  That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done too.  I don\u2019t deserve it and should, instead, be forever an outsider.  Instead, as Moses did long ago, God\u2019s Son Jesus invites me to tag along.  When I agree, he connects me to himself, making me a citizen of a country that will forever be blessed by the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: How wonderful it is to be invited to join God\u2019s people on their journey!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sign me up Numbers 10: If you come with us, we\u2019ll make sure that you share in all the good things God will do for us.
