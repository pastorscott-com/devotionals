Then, I ended up traveling for a living, sometimes being gone weeks at a time. That, for me, cured my wander-lust and when that period of my life ended I emotionally overcompensated and became a homebody for several years. These days, I&#8217;m back to traveling again, but I confess that I still like the comforts of home.\u00a0 I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s possible to be too comfortable. Sometimes, God has things he wants to do in my life: transitions he wants to take me through. He has something better for me, yet I hesitate. \u201cLord, it isn\u2019t all that bad right here \u2013 if it is all the same to you, I think I\u2019ll just settle down here in this place of comfort.\u201d It makes perfect sense to me \u2013 but to fail here is to miss something much better he has for me. When Abraham obeys the Lord in the call to begin a journey into the unknown, he\u2019s about to leave the comfort of home and set out on a decades-long journey. There are going to be some big bumps in the road but the destination the Lord has in mind for him is going to make it all worthwhile. What\u2019s true for this, the first Patriarch, is true for you and me too: God initiated trips are always worth taking.<br \/>\nTake away: Don\u2019t get too comfortable and miss out on something better the Lord might have in store.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Road trip!
