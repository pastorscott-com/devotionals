Perhaps the broad view is the best one. History is marching to a climax and as that climax draws near the world&#8217;s going to experience powerful and disturbing events. As the fifth seal is removed we see those martyred for their faithfulness to the Lord. In John\u2019s day people are already suffering for their faith. John, himself, in fact, is exiled from the church. However, things are going to get worse. Many will die on the floor of the Coliseum in Rome. History, in fact, will see many faithful Christians die as martyrs. Sad to say, it continues to this day. John hears their voices as they cry out for justice. They\u2019re told that the day of justice is coming. As I think about these who&#8217;ve followed Jesus even into death I feel small and insignificant. I confess that I\u2019m hardly worthy to share the name \u201cChristian\u201d with them. I don\u2019t want to forget that my heritage of faith has been a costly one. I don\u2019t want to forget those who, even as I write these words, are paying a dear price for standing firm in their faith. At the same time, the promise of this passage speaks to my heart today. These have already been given \u201cwhite robes\u201d \u2013 honored in heaven. The day will come when the books will be balanced and justice will prevail. It doesn\u2019t take my feeling any sense of vengeance at all for me to say, if God is just, then he&#8217;ll \u201cavenge their murders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The justice of the Lord demands that things be set right, and that day is, indeed, coming.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The blood of the martyrs Revelation 6: I saw the souls of those killed because they had held firm in their witness to the Word of God.
