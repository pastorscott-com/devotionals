It\u2019s not like the parables in which there\u2019s a story followed by the lesson.  Instead, there\u2019s one wonderful, challenging, powerful concept after another.  As I try to write a devotional for each chapter of the New Testament the challenge is not finding something to write about.  Rather, it\u2019s trying to dip into the huge stream of material and grab just one concept out of all the concepts and get my mind and heart around it.  Right now I\u2019m focusing in on how our Lord says we\u2019re to relate to our enemies.  I can\u2019t help but note that Jesus doesn\u2019t talk about how we\u2019re to respond \u201cif\u201d we have enemies.  He apparently takes it for granted that some folks aren\u2019t going to like us and some will go so far as to wish us harm.  What am I to do about such people?  First, Jesus says, I\u2019m to pray for them (\u201crespond with the energies of prayer\u201d).  Second, I\u2019m to return good for evil (\u201cpractice the servant life\u201d).  Third, I\u2019m to have genuine love for them (\u201clove your enemies\u201d).  Fourth, I\u2019m to go easy on them (\u201cbe easy on people\u201d).  Fifth, I\u2019m to realize I\u2019m not so wonderful myself (\u201cwipe that ugly sneer off your own face\u201d).   The key to my relationship to my enemy, according to Jesus is \u201ckindness.\u201d  The measure of that kindness is the kindness our Father shows to us.  \u201cOh Lord, let me live a life that reflects your kindness to me, even when I deal with people who aren\u2019t very kind to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Lord is quite interested in how we treat people who don\u2019t treat us well.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drinking from a fire hose Luke 6: Our Father is kind; you be kind.
