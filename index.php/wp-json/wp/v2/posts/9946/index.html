He doesn\u2019t take his assets and divide them by three.  Instead, he entrusts his servants with differing amounts based on their capabilities of handling such responsibilities.  The most gifted (and trusted) servant comes through with flying colors.  The next servant does just as well with the smaller amount placed under his control.  The third servant, though, is a miserable failure.  He wasn\u2019t considered to be especially capable in the first place, but the wealthy man took that into consideration by giving him less responsibility.  The third servant, though, doesn\u2019t even try.  He hides the money and waits for the day of accounting.  This approach angers the wealthy man and it\u2019s the undoing of the third servant who\u2019s thrown out.  He isn\u2019t fired because he didn\u2019t do as well with his money as did the first servant.  Rather, he\u2019s thrown out for doing nothing with the resources placed in his hands.  In the Kingdom of God, we\u2019re valued based on our faithfulness rather than our capability.  Had the most gifted servant hidden the larger amount placed in his care he would have been the one thrown out.  Had this third servant returned with even meager interest he would have been commended for a job well done.  The thing that concerns me today isn\u2019t that I see some who have greater ability and more high profile positions in the Kingdom of God.  My concern is that I be faithful with what the Lord has given me.  I don\u2019t want to face God with empty hands.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: What must I do to be a good steward of what God has placed in my hands?<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A little dirty, but no worse for wear Matthew 25: It\u2019s criminal to live cautiously like that!
