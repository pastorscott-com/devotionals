There are no excuses, no contributing circumstances that in any way lessen his failure. When Saul takes it upon himself to play the role of priest rather than wait on Samuel it\u2019s a horrible failure, but it\u2019s no greater than the one I read about here. David, King of Israel sees a woman taking a bath and wants her. Abusing his authority as king he sends for her and then has sexual relations with her. When she later discovers that she\u2019s pregnant, he sends for her husband in hopes of covering up his sin. The only things we know about Uriah are what we find in this story but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s an honorable man and a loyal soldier. Failing in his plan, David sends a note to his general, Joab (a note carried by Uriah, himself) that\u2019s actually a death sentence. When David receives word of Uriah&#8217;s death, he shrugs it off with &#8220;war kills.&#8221; In this case it isn&#8217;t war that kills. It\u2019s David. In the words of Agatha Christie, this is &#8220;murder most foul.&#8221; David\u2019s a great man, a real hero, and a key figure in God&#8217;s plan for the world. Still, the writers of Scripture do not avoid the issue here. They tell us the whole ugly story. Still, what happens, as unsavory as it is, isn\u2019t beyond the grace of God. I&#8217;m glad the story doesn&#8217;t end here.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord can\u2019t deal with our sin until we admit we have sinned and repent of it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Murder most foul 2 Samuel 11: War kills &#8212; sometimes one, sometimes another.
