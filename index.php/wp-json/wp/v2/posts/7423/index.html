If they refuse his warning, then they&#8217;re responsible to God for that refusal.  Ezekiel&#8217;s job is to issue God&#8217;s message.  His salvation is contingent on his faithfulness in doing so.  My first reaction to this passage is one of caution.  I read this from a New Testament point of view and immediately respond that my hope of salvation isn\u2019t in my performance but in my faith in the Savior, Jesus.  Does that, in some way nullify this passage for me today?  Upon reflection, I think not.  Old or New Testament, preacher or listener, the requirement of God is the same: obedience.  The Lord calls Ezekiel to preach his message and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s required of him.  He&#8217;s called to obedience even as he calls his listeners to obedience.  It&#8217;s the same for me.  As I understand that Jesus is the Savior of the world I must obey his call to yield my life to him and follow him.  Anything else is disobedience.  So, Ezekiel obeyed by preaching God&#8217;s message.  His listeners were to obey by forsaking their sin and worshiping the Lord.  I obey by trusting in Jesus as my Lord and Savior and living in a relationship with him.  People may refuse Ezekiel&#8217;s message, but he&#8217;ll be saved in his obedience in preaching it anyway.<br \/>\nTake Away: No matter where a person is on their spiritual journey, the Lord\u2019s requirement is this: obey.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trust and obey for there\u2019s no other way Ezekiel 3: &#8230;but you won&#8217;t die.
