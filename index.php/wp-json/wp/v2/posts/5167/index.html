Still, I see here an understanding of humanity.  While David isn\u2019t making a theological statement in this Psalm, he does make a human one.  He sees division in his heart and he believes God can unify his life.  I don&#8217;t have to overlay the centuries of theology that are yet to come to identify with that cry of faith.  Today, the Christian who struggles with division in his or her life does well to start with this Old Testament prayer, asking God to &#8220;put me together.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord can, and wants to, do a deep, transforming, uniting work in the lives of his people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Long before the American Holiness Movement Psalm 86: Put me together, one heart and mind; then, undivided, I&#8217;ll worship in joyful fear.
