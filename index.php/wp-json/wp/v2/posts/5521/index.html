This time, though, it won&#8217;t be as slaves being relocated by a conquering king.  Instead, it\u2019ll be as missionaries spreading throughout the world proclaiming God&#8217;s goodness.  Isaiah pictures them returning with those who\u2019ve responded to the message, presenting these newly found followers of the Lord to the Lord as an offering gladly received by God.  In this I see the heart of God.  His desire is that all his Creation be gathered in love; that we experience unity with one another and with him.  Jesus says the same thing when he talks about us being &#8220;one.&#8221;  As a believer I\u2019m called to participate in that missionary task; to understand the culture of my society and to go out and engage it for the cause of Christ.  The day will come when, as it is in Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy, I\u2019ll stand before God.
