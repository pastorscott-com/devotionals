That program has influenced a lot of TV news and we see programs similar to it all the time now.  Aside from TV though, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Crossfire&#8221; influenced society as much as it reflected society.  Kindness and gentleness is out and &#8220;telling it like it is&#8221; is the approach of the day.  On the internet I\u2019ve seen people who I&#8217;m sure are fine, caring Christians in person who can however, when on line, cut and slash with their words without mercy.  I think there\u2019s a great need for kindness in society.  Most people don&#8217;t need to be put in their place nearly so much as they need to be treated as people of value.   Whether we\u2019re talking about how we conduct ourselves while driving in traffic or how we speak to the slow moving clerk at Walmart God&#8217;s people ought to lead the way in this.  We\u2019re to be &#8220;helpers&#8221; and &#8220;healers&#8221; and not &#8220;wounders&#8221; and maimers.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: When under pressure or when somehow operating \u201cout of the box\u201d our words are windows to our hearts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Communicating with kindness Proverbs 15: Kind words heal and help; cutting words wound and maim.
