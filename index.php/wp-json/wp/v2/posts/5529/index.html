The stench lingers in the car even after the site of the demise of the skunk is behind me.  In commissioning Jeremiah to his life&#8217;s work, the Lord says that the culture of his nation stinks.  God\u2019s sick of it and is going to bring in enemies of theirs from the north to do a thorough cleaning.  Jeremiah&#8217;s job is to prepare the way for that event by mounting an offense against that rotten culture.  From the beginning it\u2019s made clear to him that he\u2019ll operate counter to the prevailing culture of that day.  He&#8217;s going to be the focal point of some big explosions and his only hope of surviving them is that God\u2019s going to make him rough and tough, as &#8220;solid as a concrete wall.&#8221;  Jeremiah&#8217;s ministry is to be one of confrontation.  Frankly, I doubt that the culture of my nation is any better than was that of Jeremiah&#8217;s.  If God was sick of the stench of that culture then he must be pretty tired of that of our day too.  Who knows?  Right now God might be rising up a new Jeremiah.  Whether or not that&#8217;s so, I do understand this: we believers have to do more than just go with the flow and feel pleased that we&#8217;re keeping our heads above water.  We need to take a stand for righteousness in our homes and in other places where we have influence.  Can God count on me to be a &#8220;one-man defense system&#8221; at least in those areas?<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes Christians have to take a stand for righteousness, even if that stand isn\u2019t well accepted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Walking with God against the flow Jeremiah 1: You&#8217;re a one-man defense system against this culture.
