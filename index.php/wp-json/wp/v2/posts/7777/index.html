Even though it was destroyed decades ago they\u2019ve heard stories of its glory.  A few of the old people actually saw it when they were children.  It could be that one reason the returned exiles have neglected the rebuilding of the Temple is because they don\u2019t think they can do it justice and whatever they do will be a pale reflection of the great Temple of history.  For one thing, they can\u2019t furnish it in silver and gold as their ancestors did when they first built the Temple.  Fearing that they can\u2019t do a good enough job of rebuilding they haven\u2019t started at all.  Now, in Haggai\u2019s second sermon, he tells the people they don\u2019t have to worry about that.  If they do what they can do God will do the rest.  In this case, the Lord\u2019s word is that he\u2019ll provide the silver and gold if they just get started on the building.  So what is it in my life that\u2019s never been started because I know I lack the resources to complete it?  Is my failure here not so much resource-based as it is faith-based?  Years earlier the ancestors of Haggai\u2019s congregation were told to march forward through the Red Sea.  Even though they didn\u2019t have the resources to dam up the waters, they obeyed.  When they did what they could do, God did the rest.  What might the Lord do in my life if I would simply do what I can do while trusting the One who owns the silver and gold of this world to do the rest?<br \/>\nTake Away: We do our part while trusting the Lord to do his.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Me, doing my part Haggai 2: I own the silver, I own the gold.
