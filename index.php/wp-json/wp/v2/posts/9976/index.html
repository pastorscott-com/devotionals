A man goes to his neighbor\u2019s door in the middle of the night asking to borrow some food so he can feed an unexpected guest.  However, the neighbor calls out through the closed door that he\u2019s in bed and he doesn\u2019t want to wake up the whole family to answer the request.  The man at the door, though, is persistent and is also somewhat perplexed.   His need is real and his friendship with his neighbor is genuine.  Not only that, but he knows his friend has the resources to meet his need.  Perplexed or not, his faith in the good will and resources of his friend is unshaken.  He doesn\u2019t know why his friend doesn\u2019t respond right off, but he persists, knocking again and again until his neighbor responds.  Now, this story is told by our Lord to teach us to stay with it when we pray.  The minor detail of the reluctant neighbor being in bed, etc. isn\u2019t what this story is about.  Obviously, unanswered prayer isn\u2019t the result of the Lord taking a nap.  The role of the Almighty is not in play here.  This little illustration is about us.  When I have a need, I can go directly to the Lord with that need.  I go in assurance that he welcomes me to do so, and in faith that he has all the resources necessary to meet that need.  With good will and faith I ask.  On those occasions when the answer doesn\u2019t come, Jesus tells me that it\u2019s not against the rules for me to ask again.  After all, like the man in the story, my need is real and I\u2019m certain that my Neighbor can meet that need and that he\u2019s my friend.  I don\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t yet responded, but I do understand his good will toward me.  So what do I do?  I ask again: humbly, in faith, and probably with a bit more urgency.  Asking again doesn\u2019t show a lack of faith.  In fact, it\u2019s an affirmation of it.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s nice when prayers are answered immediately, but when they aren\u2019t it is okay for me to ask again, and again, if necessary.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Persisting in prayer Luke 11: Ask and you\u2019ll get; Seek and you\u2019ll find; Knock and the door will open.
