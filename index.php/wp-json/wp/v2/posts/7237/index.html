They spread their wings and soar like eagles.<br \/>\nIsaiah says that when everything else gives way that &#8220;God lasts.&#8221;  He doesn&#8217;t lose interest and he doesn&#8217;t grow weary.  Everything else can, and will, fail, either intentionally or unintentionally but God never fails.  Beyond that, God&#8217;s people draw strength from him.  We\u2019re still human and because of that we face the frailties of humanity.  Still, as we trust in the Lord and lean on him we find strength where it matters the most.  The strength to soar like an eagle isn\u2019t strength to win races or ball games.  It isn&#8217;t strength to never fail in the events of life.  It\u2019s spiritual strength to live in a victorious relationship with our Creator even in the face of our humanity.  When Isaiah talks about people who run and don&#8217;t get tired he\u2019s talking about the race of life.  The body wears out and begins to fall apart.  Physically, we spend 25 years or so gaining strength and then 50 years giving back, little by little, what we\u2019ve gained.  Spiritually though, as we &#8220;wait upon God&#8221; we finish the race with all the vigor we had at the beginning of it because he renews us day by day.  It\u2019s a bit of a paradox, but very often the people we know who on the outside seem to have the least strength are the very ones who &#8220;soar like eagles&#8221; in spirit.<br \/>\nTake Away: The people of the Lord draw strength from him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Soaring like eagles Isaiah 40: Those who wait upon God get fresh strength.
