Ask.<br \/>\nStudents of the Old Testament have long marveled at the wisdom of Solomon who, when offered anything from the Lord, asks for wisdom.  In fact, the Lord, himself, is pleased with the request.  Today, though, I find myself thinking about the question the Lord asks Solomon.  Really, at this point Solomon has done little to cause the Lord to be impressed with him and, to be brutally honest, as I see his life being played out, I doubt he\u2019s worthy of it.  I understand that he\u2019s assuming David\u2019s throne and is now the leader of the people God has chosen to be his very own and in this passage I see that he starts off on the right foot, beginning his reign with a great worship service.  Still, by any measure this is an unprecedented offer by the Almighty.  God wants to bless Solomon.  He wants this young man to be successful in all he does.  Because of that, the Lord basically signs a blank check and hands it to him.  I\u2019m taken here with God\u2019s good will toward us.  He may not, like a genie, grant us anything we wish, but he does give us good things.  Without doubt, he treats us better than we deserve.  I know the focus on this passage is on Solomon\u2019s answer, but today I\u2019m taken with the abundance of grace in the question.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord delights in blessing us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abundance of grace 2 Chronicles 1: What do you want from me?
