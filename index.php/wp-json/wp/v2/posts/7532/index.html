This time he dreams of a larger-than-life tree that commands the landscape and provides for all around it.  In the dream God orders the tree to be cut down but the stump be saved.  Nebuchadnezzar wants to know the meaning of the dream and Daniel comes through for him.  The king\u2019s &#8220;statue&#8221; dream was about his kingdom.  His &#8220;tree&#8221; dream is about him personally.  The Lord&#8217;s weary of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s ignoring him.  When there are miraculous events that declare God Almighty to him Nebuchadnezzar gives God lip service, but goes on living his own way.  This time, the Lord will touch his life directly to humble him enough that he&#8217;ll stop merely declaring the Lord to be God but will start acting as though he believes it.  After explaining the dream to Nebuchadnezzar Daniel pleads with him to respond now and avoid the reality of what he&#8217;s dreamed.  In other words, through the dream and Daniel&#8217;s interpretation of it Nebuchadnezzar is being given a choice.  If he continues as he is the dream will become reality.  If he repents right now and changes his ways he can continue &#8220;to have a good life.&#8221;  I see this as an example of the openness of God.  Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s future isn&#8217;t already set, but based on how he responds to this warning, it&#8217;s already known.  If he heeds this warning from God things will go one way.  If he ignores it, things will go the other.  In this I see the Lord as knowing, not just one set future, but all possible futures.  In this application we see God not only warning Nebuchadnezzar, but offering him a much more desirable alternative.  Still, the Lord won&#8217;t negate his free will&#8230;the ball is in Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s court.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord has granted us free will, but he holds us accountable for our exercise of that free will.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Take your pick Daniel 4: Make a clean break with your sins&#8230;quit your wicked life&#8230;then you will continue to have a good life.
