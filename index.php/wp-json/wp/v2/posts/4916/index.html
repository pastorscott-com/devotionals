Asa has just won a miraculous battle and is returning home to celebrate his victory when he\u2019s met by this man of God. Azariah has a message from the Lord for Asa. The Lord has good things in mind for Asa and for his kingdom. If Asa will keep his head screwed on straight and keep his eyes on God he\u2019ll be blessed with the unfailing presence of the Lord throughout his reign. Asa takes this message to heart and goes all out for God. He calls his subjects to \u201cseek God&#8230;wholeheartedly, holding nothing back.\u201d The result is just what the Lord promised. God shows up bringing peace and prosperity to the kingdom. This is a wonderfully encouraging passage. God wants to bless us and help us and be with us. He promises to make himself available to those who seek him. A family, church, or nation that covenants to seek God wholeheartedly gets God\u2019s attention and receives his blessings. I\u2019m not thinking so much of health and wealth here as I am about spiritual well-being. Still, I think that living in an intimate relationship with God brings blessings that often spill over into our lives in unexpected, pleasant ways. Either way, the promise of God\u2019s presence and his willingness to be \u201cfound\u201d ought to excite us and stir us to action.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord isn\u2019t playing hide and seek with us. Rather, he makes himself wonderfully available to all who seek him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What a wonderful promise! 2 Chronicles 15: If you look for him he will let himself be found.
