To presume on God&#8217;s grace is to ignore his justice.  Moses tells the people to be careful that they don&#8217;t mess with God.  They have made certain commitments that include promising to keep the ground rules God has laid out.  What\u2019s true for them is true for me.  It isn&#8217;t that God requires perfect behavior from me &#8212; that&#8217;s beyond my reach.  However, he does require me to keep faith with him.  He requires me to live my life as a man of God and to be open to his correction and leadership in my life.  This relationship is not only my valued treasure, but is also my greatest responsibility.
