We were raised in church traditions that stressed externals and the weight of that emphasis fell especially on the girls and young women.  Looking back, I feel somewhat charitable toward those who stressed such things.  I think, by and large, their hearts were in the right place.  After all, they wanted to live holy, clean lives and our personal holiness ought to be evident even in the clothing we choose to wear.  However, the years have pretty much proven that traveling that road leads to the city of legalism which is quite distant from the city of love and grace.  In this passage we\u2019re told that there&#8217;s a wardrobe that&#8217;s appropriate for God\u2019s people but it has nothing to do with how much or little skin is shown.  God\u2019s people are to be characterized &#8212; \u201cclothed in\u201d &#8212; \u201ccompassion, kindness, humility, quiet strength, discipline.\u201d  We\u2019re to be known as \u201ceven-tempered, content\u2026quick to forgive.\u201d  The absolute necessity for all followers of Jesus, Paul says, is the \u201cbasic, all-purpose garment\u201d of love.  He emphasizes love by saying, \u201cdon\u2019t leave home without it.\u201d  So, there I have it.  My Christianity isn\u2019t seen in what I wear, but it is seen as these positive characteristics are on display in my life.  It was easier to focus on \u201ccovering up\u201d but such an emphasis totally misses what it really means to dress like a Christian.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christ should be seen in our lives, not so much by what we wear, but by the display of Christ-like characteristics. <\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dressing like a Christian Colossians 3: Dress in the wardrobe God picked out for you.
