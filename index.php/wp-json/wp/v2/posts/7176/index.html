The writer is impressed by all God has done in the world, but frustrated that he can&#8217;t understand the meaning of it all.  I played golf with a fellow who had a long pre-shot routine that he went through every time he hit the ball.  He shuffled his feet a specific way, waggled the club for what seemed to be an eternity, and then stood frozen over the ball before finally hitting his horrible slice.  I wanted to shout out, &#8220;Just hit the ball!&#8221;  No doubt, he needed some golfing lessons, but even I could see that he was over-thinking his golf swing.  He had himself tied up in knots and it created, not an athletic, fluid golf shot, but a poor shot and a frustrated golfer.  Solomon is frustrated that, after all his thinking and considering, he can&#8217;t understand all God does.  He decides that &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing better to do than go ahead and have a good time and get the most we can out of life.&#8221;  That isn&#8217;t a ticket to living an immoral, God-ignoring life, but it&#8217;s a reminder that life is a gift of God and if we over-think it we, like my golfer friend, will spend way too much time out in the weeds rather than enjoying the beauty that has been freely given to us.<br \/>\nTake Away: Life is a gift meant to be enjoyed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Golf lessons Ecclesiastes 3: God made everything beautiful in itself and in its time &#8212; but he&#8217;s left us in the dark.
