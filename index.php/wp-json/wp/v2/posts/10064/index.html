It seems that he wants to be sure his readers understand just how freely God wants his people to live their lives. He tells them that if they go to the butcher to buy meat, just buy it without worrying about whether or not it was once part of a sacrifice to an idol. He doesn\u2019t want Christians to live their lives in fear that they\u2019re going to somehow mess up and get God upset with them. Of course, there are common sense rules to apply. If a Christian is a guest somewhere and the host says, \u201cNow, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll want to join me in eating this particular piece of meat, as I\u2019m eating it as part of a fellowship meal with an idol\u201d then it\u2019s plain that whether or not one eats that meat is a big deal to the host. Still, Paul\u2019s message here is that I don\u2019t have to live in fear that I\u2019m going to somehow accidentally say or do or eat the wrong thing and get on the wrong side of God. Rather, I\u2019m to live the life of a person who&#8217;s loved by God and who&#8217;s free to enjoy all the good things he sends to my life. So, praise the Lord, and might I have just a bit more of that excellent pot roast!<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Christian life is to be one of joyful, thankful, freedom.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Freedom in Christ 1Corinthians 10: I\u2019m not going to walk around on eggshells.
