Zephaniah is focused especially on Judah but he broadens his view to include the surrounding nations and he lays a foundation for the doctrine of a future Day of Judgment of the human race. As the prophet looks around he sees a nation that\u2019s not only committed to sin but feels secure in that sin. He, along with other prophets of God, challenges that security. He knows that people can\u2019t ignore God and get away with it. Any comfort they have now will, in God\u2019s time, be washed away when they&#8217;re called to give an account of themselves to the Almighty. He warns them that God says, \u201cI care about sin with fiery passion.\u201d Zephaniah\u2019s message carries with it a sense of God\u2019s anger but it also offers some hope to those who \u201cshape up.\u201d There\u2019s hope in this little book, but it comes with a main course of respectful awe of just Who it is we&#8217;re dealing with and what&#8217;s sure to come to those who ignore its warning.<br \/>\nTake Away: Those who ignore the Lord will, sooner or later, have to give an accounting of themselves to the one they have ignored.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A heaping helping of judgment with a little hope on the side Zephaniah 1: This is the Day of God\u2019s Judgment.
