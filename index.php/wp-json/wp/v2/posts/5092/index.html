Job insists on his integrity and stubbornly holds to his faith even though he feels God is treating him unfairly.  His friends have become his accusers.  Ever though they can&#8217;t point to a single act of unrighteousness in his life, they point to his terrible afflictions as proof that there has to be unrighteousness.  Job characterizes this as their using his &#8220;troubles as a stick to beat me.&#8221;  By now we\u2019re supposed to understand that the suffering has come to Job precisely because he is righteous.  It\u2019s this righteousness that sets this chain of events in motion in the first place.  The question being answered is &#8220;does Job serve God out of love and commitment or is it because of the good things he gets out of it?&#8221;  Is human righteousness a part of some kind of business arraignment between man and God or is there something deeper going on?  Of course, all this is beyond Job&#8217;s friends and is beyond Job himself.  His friends are so overwhelmed by the terrible scene of suffering before them that they can\u2019t see anything else.  I think we\u2019re all in danger of living at that level.  We like the easy way out, the conventional wisdom, and cling to easily held beliefs.  Sooner or later, God will challenge such an approach to life, taking us deeper even, if necessary, over our groans of protest.<br \/>\nTake Away: Easily held beliefs are often the hardest ones to let go.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paddling around in the shallow end of the pool Job 19: Why do you insist on putting me down, using my troubles as a stick to beat me?
