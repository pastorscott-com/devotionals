Some suggest that he\u2019s a student of Isaiah because of their similarities. However, Isaiah lives in Jerusalem and has some strong connections there. Micah (like Amos) lives away from Jerusalem in a farming community. His focus, as is that of Amos, is on how the poor are treated by so-called religious people who tend to divorce their religious activities from how they actually live their lives. Micah is a witty guy who likes to use puns to make his points. Sadly, these puns are lost outside the original language. As we read from The Message we find them restored, but they\u2019re almost lost from the other direction. When Micah says \u201cGlorytown has seen its last of glory\u201d he\u2019s using a play on words. He\u2019s named a real town whose name sounds like \u201cglory.\u201d The best modern example of this I\u2019ve seen is the suggestion that it would be like Micah to say \u201cWiscon-sin needs to give up its sin.\u201d Anyway, the early portion this little book is full of such plays on words. Still, there\u2019s nothing light hearted about his message. Both Israel and Judah are going through the actions of serving God but in reality they\u2019re missing the boat. If things continue as they are judgment is coming. History tells us that Micah is right on target.<br \/>\nTake Away: Having a good commentary is handy sometimes and absolutely necessary at others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Puns that aren\u2019t intended to be \u201cpunny\u201d Micah 1: God\u2019s Message as it came to Micah of Moresheth.
