Sometimes they had negative messages to give and sometimes they spoke harshly but they always found a place to promise a better day.  In the face of the natural disaster that has befallen his people, Joel calls for them to take stock of their lives and repent of their sin.  Then he describes a coming better day.  He sees a day when God will \u201cmake up for the years of the locust,\u201d restoring what has been destroyed.  He pictures tables full of food and people filled with words of praise and thanksgiving.  Then Joel says, \u201cIf you think that stuff sounds good wait till you hear what else is coming!\u201d  He then describes a day of wonderful blessing in which God pours his Spirit out upon, not just one nation, but upon all the nations of the world.  He says that in that day their sons and daughters will prophecy and people from all nations and stations of life will be blessed.  This event, Joel says, will happen before the \u201cJudgment Day of God.\u201d  Years later Peter will quote these words on the Day of Pentecost.  Peter will tell people that they\u2019re literally seeing this \u201cSpirit pouring\u201d promise being fulfilled before their very eyes.  Even today, we live in that \u201cin between\u201d period of history.  We&#8217;re between the outpouring of the Spirit and the Judgment Day of God.  What a wonderful time in which to live!  We&#8217;re in the \u201cday of the Spirit.\u201d  This is the time when, according to Joel, \u201cWhoever calls, \u2018Help, God!\u2019 gets help.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: What a wonderful thing it is to live in the \u201cday of the Spirit.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living in the day of the Spirit Joel 2: I will pour out my Spirit on every kind of people.
