No question, he wants to care for us and to bless our lives. Also, there\u2019s the truth that mere human freedom is not the ultimate need of man. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I believe in freedom and thank God for it. However, the greatest need of humanity is not for liberty. Rather, the need is for changed hearts.
