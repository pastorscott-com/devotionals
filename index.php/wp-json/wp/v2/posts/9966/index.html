He\u2019s the priest who\u2019ll enter the sanctuary and burn incense before the Lord. As he carefully and reverently goes about this task he sees movement to the right of the altar, then, out of nowhere an angel of the Lord appears. Zechariah would run if he could, but instead just stands there, eyes wide, mouth open, face to face with an archangel. The angel speaks reassuringly, and, to the old priest\u2019s surprise, calls him by name. Then this angel adds, \u201cYour prayer has been heard.\u201d I wonder what thoughts raced through Zechariah\u2019s mind in that instant. Here\u2019s what I think: I imagine the old priest thinking, \u201cWhat prayer is that?\u201d You see, there was a time in his and Elizabeth\u2019s lives when they prayed for a child most every day. They were young then and all the other couples they knew were having babies. However, time was passing and they remained childless. The years passed and they were no longer a young couple. They prayed about this less and then they gave up, disappointed but trusting God with their emptiness. Now, years later, when Gabriel says, \u201cYour prayer has been answered\u201d my guess is that the \u201cbaby prayer\u201d is the farthest thing from Zechariah\u2019s mind. Zachariah might have forgotten the prayer, but God hasn\u2019t. Now, at the time that seems way too late for this senior adult couple, God is about to move. Once again I\u2019m reminded that God\u2019s ways aren\u2019t my ways and his schedule isn\u2019t my schedule. Beyond that, I see that God\u2019s ways are the right ways and his time is always the right time. This realization has plenty of practical applications in my life today.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Never doubt the power of prayer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exactly, what prayer was that?
