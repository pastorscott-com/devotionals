I&#8217;ve read books about it, talked about it, and practiced it.  I\u2019ve learned that there are different ways to pray.  For instance, a person can kneel by their bedside or sit in an easy chair with a cup of coffee or write out a prayer or take a &#8220;prayer walk.&#8221;  These and several other approaches are good ways to pray.  One deal breaker to prayer is what is stated in this proverb: one way praying.  Prayer is intended to be a conversation with God.  It isn&#8217;t about my airing my list of wants and concerns while God patiently stands by like the waitress in a restaurant taking an order.  I\u2019ve found that, generally speaking, it\u2019s my perspective that\u2019s changed in prayer.  The wise man of the proverbs reminds me of the conversational nature of prayer.  Of course, there\u2019s another aspect of &#8220;listening&#8221; here.  When I spend time in the Presence of God and he does speak I\u2019m to listen to what he says.  That is, I\u2019m to take it to heart and move forward in obedience.  Often, I\u2019ve found, God intends to use me in answer to my own prayers.  He has work for me to do and, no matter how fervently I continue to pray, nothing will come of it until I start listening to what the Lord\u2019s saying to me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Often, the Lord intends to use us in answer to our own prayers<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No one way praying allowed Proverbs 28: God has no use for the prayers of people who won&#8217;t listen to him.
