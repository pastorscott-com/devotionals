Micah talks to adults who are committing adult-level sins.  The result of those sins will be not a slap on the wrist, but national destruction with pain and death everywhere.  It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.  Micah tells his people that mercy is a specialty of God and that the Lord much prefers granting mercy and forgetting sins to destroying those who live in rebellion against him.  Micah assures his listeners that the Lord anxiously waits to forgive and forget; to show mercy and compassion on them.  I sang the chorus as a child but as an adult I realize what an amazing offer it is.
