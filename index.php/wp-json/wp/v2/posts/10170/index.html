We\u2019re now at the sounding of the final trumpet and once it sounds Judgment Day has arrived as time comes to an end. However, John has much more to see as the description of specific events will be expanded. Before that final trumpet sounds John&#8217;s given the same task Daniel was given many years earlier. He\u2019s to measure the \u201cTemple and Altar and everyone worshiping\u201d there. One understanding of this that works for me is that this is a measurement of God\u2019s Church in preparation for judgment. Everything&#8217;s about to wrap up and the time Jesus referred to as a dividing of sheep and goats is about to begin. Now John&#8217;s given the task of seeing how the Church, represented by the Temple and Altar in the vision, measures up. As John prepares to go to work he\u2019s told to ignore those in the outside court. They may be hanging around the Temple and appear to belong. However, they aren\u2019t part of the worshiping body. I\u2019m not claiming to have figured things out here but there\u2019s a lot of truth in that interpretation. At some point the Church will be measured and people will give an account of themselves to the Judge of the world. Just hanging around the fringes won\u2019t cut it. Those who are faithful, serving the Lord, worshiping him in both good days and bad, though, have nothing to fear even in the fearful days described in this passage.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Oh I want to be in that number when the saints go marching in.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Measuring up Revelation 11: Get up and measure God\u2019s Temple and Altar and everyone worshiping in it.
