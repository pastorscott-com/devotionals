The question asked by the Lord resonates with me.  &#8220;My friend Job&#8221; is an awesome phrase to hear the Lord utter.  This is the Almighty, the Creator of the Universe who\u2019s talking.  He\u2019s speaking of a man; flesh and blood with human frailties and failings.  But that man is a friend of God and God is a friend to him.  When I consider the fact that this story is told long before Jesus, God Incarnate, walks this earth I\u2019m blown away.  We don&#8217;t know the identity of the writer of this book of the Bible, but he or she has an understanding of God and his relationship with us that ought to thrill us.  It ought to challenge us too.  Today, I have more reason than ever to aspire to and achieve friendship with God.  I can not only be a servant of the Lord who worships him in his holiness, I can be his friend too.  What a wonderful possibility!<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s an amazing privilege to be invited to be a friend with our Creator.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of God\u2019s friends Job 1: Have you noticed my friend Job?
