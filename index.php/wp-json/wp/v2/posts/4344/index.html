The thing is, not only is Moses familiar with spiritual failure, he\u2019s also familiar with God&#8217;s grace.  Time after time he\u2019s seen God reach out to these people in mercy, love, and forgiveness.

He tells them, &#8220;Before anything else, God is a compassionate God.&#8221;  Even if his warnings to these people go unheeded, God&#8217;s character will be unchanged.
