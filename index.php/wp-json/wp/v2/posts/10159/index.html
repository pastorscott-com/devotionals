In fact, you might call this an \u201cemergency letter.\u201d Jude has received disturbing news concerning happenings in an unnamed church. Events there are unfolding that could result in their turning away from the faith. He quickly reminds them of just how dangerous this is, listing one event after another from the Old Testament about spiritual failure and its consequences. Jude is just a short no-chapter book but if one takes time to follow all the references, the book expands considerably. The bottom line, though, is that they\u2019ve allowed teachers into their number who aren\u2019t teaching the Gospel. The result is that a cancer has begun to grow in the church that, if left unchecked, will have disastrous effects of biblical proportions concerning their salvation. Jude gives them a plan of action and urges them to act immediately. They\u2019re to focus on the \u201cmost holy faith\u201d and to pray \u201cin the Holy Spirit\u201d and to stay \u201cright at the center of God\u2019s love\u201d and keep their \u201carms open and outstretched\u201d to receive the mercy of Jesus in their lives. As they deal with those who are already wavering in the faith they\u2019re to tread lightly and as they deal with those who are outside the church, the sinners, they\u2019re to take it easy on them while standing firm against their sin. Jude has already told them what to do about the false teachers who have infiltrated their church: they\u2019re to \u201cfight with everything\u201d they have \u201cfor the faith entrusted\u201d to them. As I read this \u201ctwo-page book\u201d I\u2019m reminded to be careful about who I allow to influence my spiritual life. Not everyone who claims to speak for Christ does so. At the same time I\u2019m reminded not to get too worked up over this kind of stuff. Jude says: \u201cRelax, everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d As I focus on the basics of love and prayer and the like, things will work out just fine for me.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s a challenge for Christians to major on the majors and to minor on the minors and to tell one from the other.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bible\u2019s \u201cemergency letter\u201d Jude: I\u2019ve dropped everything to write you.
