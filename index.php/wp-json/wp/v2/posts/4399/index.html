They slip into the walled city and take up residence in what was likely a common place of lodging.  The commentators tell me that Rahab\u2019s house was likely a tavern and inn.  While some squirm around Rahab\u2019s being called a \u201charlot\u201d it\u2019s likely that the scriptures are simply telling it as it is.  We\u2019re talking about a Canaanite women living in a Canaanite town here.  When she acts to protect the spies it isn\u2019t because she\u2019s gotten saved in a revival meeting!  She\u2019s acting out of self-preservation.  Still, her actions carry real weight.  In spite of her questionable past and her lack of knowledge about the God of the Israelites she\u2019s concluded that this God of theirs is powerful and will deliver Canaan to his people.  She may not know the Ten Commandments or the Shema or the story of Abraham and Isaac, but she\u2019s heard enough about this God that she\u2019d rather be on his side than on the side of the people and gods of Canaan.  In what might be considered a \u201cpractical conversion\u201d she picks that God over all others.  Hopefully, in the years to come her theology will mature and her relationship with God and his people will deepen.  However, for all of us, our faith journey has to start somewhere.  Deciding one would rather be on God\u2019s side in the battle isn\u2019t a bad place to start.<br \/>\nTake Away: All spiritual life begins with a simple decision concerning one\u2019s relationship to the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A practical conversion Joshua 2: They left and arrived at the house of a harlot named Rahab and stayed there.
