At one point in his vision he&#8217;s given a scroll and told to eat it.  He reports that it tastes like honey.  When the Lord applies the vision he tells Ezekiel that he needs to fully digest the message he has for the exiles.  God&#8217;s message needs to become part of him to the point that even if people disagree or simply refuse to listen to him that he&#8217;ll have absolute confidence in what he says.  While I don&#8217;t enjoy arguing religion, I certainly enjoy talking about it.  I love dealing with the finer points of the faith, especially the more difficult to understand passages.  However, there are some things that ought not to be subject to debate.  I&#8217;ve learned that there are a few, very few, absolute basics that need to be swallowed hook, line, and sinker.  They&#8217;re to become as much a part of me as are my heart and lungs.  It&#8217;s not that I refuse to discuss them, but that they are at the core of my existence.  Without diving off into the deep end of the pool here, I think I can name them off the top of my head.  First, God is.  Second, Jesus is the Son of God who died for my sins and was resurrected to life.  Third, as I trust in Jesus as my Savior I have the hope of eternal life in him.  These truths not only &#8220;taste like honey,&#8221; they also make me who I am today and for eternity.<br \/>\nTake Away: Some things are debatable and a few, just a few, aren&#8217;t.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Basics Ezekiel 3: Get all these words that I&#8217;m giving you inside you.
