Not only are they working very hard, but they\u2019re working with defense against an attack in mind so there\u2019s also mental fatigue. Meanwhile, life goes on. These men have families to feed and bills to pay. The work on wall is vitally important but there\u2019s no income from it. To make ends meet, they go to the local business men for loans. In spite of the fact that the restoration of the wall is to everyone&#8217;s benefit the loan sharks take advantage of the problem faced by the workers. When Nehemiah learns what\u2019s happening he\u2019s furious. He calls for a meeting and reads the riot act to these financial predators. Both the fear of the Lord and fear of Nehemiah takes hold and the gouging of the workmen stops immediately. What a situation! The workers face the challenging task of rebuilding, the threats of their enemies, and the greedy business practices of their fellow Jews. In some ways, this is the unkindest cut of all. Yet it often happens, even within the church. As many pull together to accomplish some worthy goal there are those who can&#8217;t see the big picture because they\u2019re blinded by their own agenda. When that happens those doing the real work are distracted or discouraged from their task. Nehemiah dealt with this problem head on. Our tendency is to just try to work through stuff like this. Sometimes that\u2019s probably best, but not always. I pray that the Lord will give us wisdom to know when Nehemiah\u2019s course of action is necessary and then help us to follow it.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we ignore some problems they will go away, but not always. Sometimes leaders have to deal with issues head on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Easy money Nehemiah 5: What you&#8217;re doing is wrong.
