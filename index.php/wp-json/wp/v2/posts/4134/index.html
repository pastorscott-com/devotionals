For over 20 years he\u2019s thought his son was dead, killed by a wild animal. Now, he\u2019s to leave the land promised to his grandfather, Abraham, and join Joseph in Egypt. With a region-wide famine ravishing the land and Joseph calling him to Egypt Jacob is ready to go; well, almost. As he begins the relocation of his family, Jacob stops at Beersheba. This is the site of a well that was dug by his ancestor Abraham. It was also a favorite location of his father, Isaac. Jacob comes to Beersheba to seek the face of God and the Lord doesn\u2019t disappoint. The promise is a wonderful one. God will go with Jacob to Egypt and he\u2019ll prosper him there. When the time is right, Canaan will be given to his family, just as the Lord promised Abraham. With this promise ringing in his ears, Jacob leads his family to Egypt. I really like all I see here. Jacob\u2019s returning to holy ground to seek God\u2019s direction makes perfect sense and the response of the Lord proves the wisdom of this action. I need to remember to seek God before making big decisions. Actually, come to think of it, I need to practice for the big decisions by seeking his face in the minor ones too.<br \/>\nTake away: It makes good sense to seek the wisdom of God as I make decisions in my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seeking God\u2019s direction Genesis 46: I\u2019ll go with you down to Egypt.
