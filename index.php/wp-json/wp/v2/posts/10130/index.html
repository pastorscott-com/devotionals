Both are intended to be not only read, but studied. The writer of Hebrews tells his readers that he\u2019s about to take them out into some deep waters, at least that\u2019s his desire. The problem, he says, is that some aren\u2019t ready for that journey. It would be understandable if they were fresh, new believers. However, he\u2019s focusing on those who\u2019ve been around awhile; who, by now, should be ready to move on in their understanding of spiritual things. There are, I see, various stages in our lives in Christ. Spiritual babes need to focus on the basics. Once those are mastered, it\u2019s time to move on, not leaving those things behind, but, instead, building on them as we move forward. On one hand, it\u2019s dangerous for people to \u201ccamp out\u201d just inside the gate. On the other hand, it\u2019s dangerous for people to jump into the deeper water without first learning to swim. The church should be a place for people at the various stages of spiritual life. People should find their way in, become established, move into the deeper things of God and then begin helping others who are just finding their way in. Personally, I\u2019m somewhere on that journey, farther along than others are but not as advanced as the rest. I think that in our eyes the destination is most important while in God\u2019s eyes the journey is more important than the destination.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Spiritual growth is necessary in the Christian life \u2013 but it\u2019s not automatic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The importance of the journey Hebrews 5: Milk is for beginners\u2026solid food is for the mature.
