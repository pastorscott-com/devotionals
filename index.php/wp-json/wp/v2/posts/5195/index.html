It\u2019s a celebration of God&#8217;s connection to our lives.  The writer doesn&#8217;t have any concept of an absentee God who spun the world up to speed and then moved on to other things.  He doesn&#8217;t think of God as aloof and disinterested.  His God is an involved God, deeply connected to his life.  The psalmist can see the hand of this involved God when he looks back on the events of his life.  He has no doubt that the Lord will continue to be connected to him.  David imagines his playing a game of &#8220;hide and seek&#8221; with God, not that he wants to be hidden from God for a moment, but that he wants to be sure of God&#8217;s knowledge of his life no matter where he might be.  In this imaginary game, David goes mountain climbing, and then spelunking in the depths.   As he arrives at those remote, hidden places it\u2019s no surprise to him that God is already there waiting on him.  The psalmist finds that God always finds him in both the extremes of life and the common places as well.  This psalm speaks to all of us who love the Lord and don&#8217;t want to live for even one moment outside his grace and mercy.<br \/>\nTake Away: Where ever I am, God is there first.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Playing hide and seek with God Psalm 139: Your reassuring presence, coming and going.
