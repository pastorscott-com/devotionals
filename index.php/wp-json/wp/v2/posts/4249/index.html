Today I read, \u201cIf anyone sins by breaking any of the commandments of God which must not be broken, but without being aware of it at the time, the moment he does realize his guilt he is held responsible.\u201d  So much of this book of rules and regulations seems out of touch.  They&#8217;re part of the Old Covenant and therefore subject to modification by the superior New Covenant.  Still, there are principles that can be applied anywhere and anytime.  This is one of them.  Responsibility is linked to knowledge.  It\u2019s when I realize that I&#8217;ve come up short that I\u2019m responsible for making things right.  There\u2019s grace in this \u2013 that is, God isn\u2019t waiting for me to mess up so he can come down on me like a load of bricks (if so, I sure wouldn\u2019t be writing these words right now).  There\u2019s also responsibility here \u2013 once I do know, I can\u2019t retreat to, \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d  If possible, I must make it right.  I must acknowledge my failure and repent of it.  To do otherwise is to presume on God\u2019s grace and to bring condemnation upon myself.<br \/>\nTake Away: To know is to be responsible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How God\u2019s people live Leviticus 5: \u2026the moment he does realize his guilt he is held responsible.
