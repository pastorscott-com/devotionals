This, though, is an amazing description of an event hundreds of years before it happens.  What a picture it is: God&#8217;s chosen one, the Savior, being brutalized; ripped and torn and crushed.  Isaiah&#8217;s description causes us to wince and maybe to turn the page to something else.  However, if the picture of horror he paints for us is greatly disturbing, the reason for it is even more disturbing.  The Messiah, our Hope, is suffering in this horrible way for our sins: for my sins.  As hymn writer John S. B. Monsell put it, &#8220;My sins, my sins&#8230;oh how sad on Thee they fall.&#8221;  Isaiah saw it in all its terribleness.  He also recognized it for what it was.  Our sins, my sins, are the reason for it all.<br \/>\nTake Away:  Why did Jesus suffer as he did?  For an answer, look in a mirror.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Preview of the crucifixion Isaiah 53: It was our sins that did that to him.
