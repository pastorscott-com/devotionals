However, Isaiah&#8217;s statement about God&#8217;s presence brings that scene to mind.

No matter what happens I need to remember that God got there first and can handle things just fine.<br \/>\nTake Away: It doesn\u2019t take much for me to be in over my head so I\u2019d best trust in the Lord in such situations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Langoliers theology Isaiah 41: Who did this? &#8230; I did.
