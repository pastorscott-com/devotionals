And the best of the three is love.<\/p>\n<p>I firmly believe all God\u2019s Word is inspired but some of it inspires me more than other parts. This is such a passage. Paul rises to new heights of writing as he describes the supremacy of love. It\u2019s no surprise that these words are heard in weddings. When a two people pledge themselves to one another in love they\u2019re committing themselves to these glorious ideals. Still, I know Paul isn\u2019t writing to a madly in love young man and woman here. Rather, he\u2019s writing to a church. In fact, he\u2019s addressing a church that isn\u2019t madly in love at all. It\u2019s a church that\u2019s more mad than in love, is fussing and fighting and making itself a spectacle in its community. As I read these words in the context of what it\u2019s really like in Corinth, I feel somewhat uncomfortable. Hopefully, in most churches today there aren\u2019t lawsuits being filed by one member against another. Still, as I gaze at this beautiful word picture of love and realize it\u2019s supposed to describe Christians relating to one another, I fear that we often fall short. The thing is, Paul hasn\u2019t departed reality and entered into some theoretical state of bliss. Near the end of this glorious writing, he confesses that right now we don\u2019t see everything God intends. We\u2019re left with instructions to concentrate on three things while we await the completion of God\u2019s purpose for his Church. We\u2019re to focus on faith, hope, and love with an emphasis on love. It\u2019s quite possible and reasonable to conclude that the church of today can operate at a level above what we see in Corinth. It\u2019s also reasonable to conclude that the ideal pictured in this passage is somewhat beyond our reach. In the middle, then, are the people of God striving to be all God intends; focusing on the Big Three as the route we\u2019re to travel as we journey to that destination.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Lord is working inside the Church to make us one, and, as we cooperate with him, that\u2019s just what he\u2019s going to do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Big Three 1Corinthians 13: Trust steadily in God, hope unswervingly, love extravagantly.
