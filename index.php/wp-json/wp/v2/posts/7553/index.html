That is, I don&#8217;t see the devil behind every bad thing that happens and I don&#8217;t think most of the events of life are being orchestrated by God.  Still, I do believe there&#8217;s an entire part of our existence that&#8217;s very real yet mostly unseen.  That isn&#8217;t really much of a stretch for us anyway.  For instance, a person born blind can be fully convinced of the reality of color even though he&#8217;s never seen it.  However, in that case the blind person has plenty of people around him who do see so he has an abundance of input concerning what is personally beyond his grasp.   When it comes to the spiritual dimension there&#8217;s much less reliable information.  We end up in passages like this one receiving just a fleeting glimpse of events beyond our normal sight.  Even then, the purpose of the passage isn\u2019t to explain all this anyway, so I have to tread very carefully here.  Daniel has an encounter with a messenger of God, an angel.  Others sense this being&#8217;s presence, but can&#8217;t see it.  They flee.  Daniel though, sees and faints at the sight!  The angel is there to talk about future events, but in passing mentions that he was delayed by another angel for three weeks and also mentions he has to go back to fight against that same being when he&#8217;s finished with Daniel.  I know that better educated people than I have worked through this passage, coming to various conclusions about the part of existence we cannot see (or concluded that this passage has nothing to do with that).  For me, I accept the fact that there are realities that I can\u2019t see.  While I don&#8217;t think I go around with a little devil on one shoulder and a little angel on the other, I do believe that this part of existence is just as real as the coffee cup sitting here on the table.  I also believe that there are times when the unseen is very close by and having a direct influence over me and what\u2019s happening in my life.  Finally, I realize that I am, in general, blind to all of this.  I have to trust the Holy Spirit, who can see it all and who was sent to be my Guide to help me navigate through the unseen part of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: We should be thankful for the guidance of the Holy Spirit who sees what we cannot see and helps us avoid that which would do us harm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The unseen part of life Daniel 10: I was waylaid by the angel-prince of the kingdom of Persia.
