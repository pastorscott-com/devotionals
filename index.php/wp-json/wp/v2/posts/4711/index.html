As someone said, &#8220;In his Sovereignty, God granted human beings the freedom to choose.&#8221; There are plenty of scriptures that speak to this concept but this isn\u2019t one of them! Just to set the story: Solomon sins against God and because of that the Lord says he\u2019ll rip the larger portion of Israel from his descendants&#8217; rule. Then, when his son Rehoboam assumes the throne he foolishly follows the wrong advice and that brings about a split in the nation. At that point we come to the statement that &#8220;God was behind all this.&#8221; This leaves me playing defense on the topic of free will. Does God cause Rehoboam to do something stupid to bring about the split between Judah and Israel? And, if that\u2019s the case, is Rehoboam responsible for what God causes him to do? Does God suspend free will in this specific circumstance? I don&#8217;t have a sweeping answer to these questions, but I don&#8217;t think God over-ruled himself on the topic of free will. Maybe this can work if I think in terms of &#8220;influence&#8221; rather than direct cause. For instance, God knows Rehoboam&#8217;s heart &#8212; that he\u2019s a stubborn, selfish man. The Lord knows that Rehoboam\u2019s friends are like him. It doesn&#8217;t take God&#8217;s pulling strings like a puppeteer to get Rehoboam to go along with the bad advice he receives. A slight suggestion is all it takes to accomplish that. Once I start thinking in terms of &#8220;influence&#8221; I more easily see how this works in both negative and positive ways. If my desire is to please the Lord in all I do, it won&#8217;t take much of a nudge from God to get me moving in the right direction. I\u2019m not claiming that I\u2019ve resolved all the &#8220;free-will verses God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8221; issues here, but I think it is a step in the right direction.<br \/>\nTake Away: I\u2019ve been granted free will. Will I or won\u2019t I use that gift to allow the Lord to positively influence me in the decisions of my life?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s not my fault, God made me do it 1Kings 12: God was behind all this&#8230; I\u2019m a firm believer in the God-given gift of free will.
