Before moving on to the deeper things of God what are the basics that must be first mastered. Using the lingo of the university, what courses are included in Christianity 101? The writer of Hebrews lists 5 \u201ccourses\u201d that must be passed before the believer is ready to deal with more advanced topics. First is trust in God. For me to even be a Christian in the first place I must stop trusting in myself as a source of salvation and start trusting in the Lord. Second is baptism. This entry sacrament is an important part of my becoming a participant in the grace of God and shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Third is \u201claying on of hands.\u201d This may be the most challenging of the five, but I think it\u2019s an understanding that God calls people to the ministry and that the church is to recognize that they are called and then to ordain them as set apart for service and leadership by the Lord. Perhaps this needs to be understood early in the Christian life because the Lord often calls people to a life of ministry early on, or even as a part of, their salvation experience. Fourth is \u201cresurrection of the dead.\u201d Believers are, well, believers. We believe Jesus was resurrected from the grave on that first Easter morning. We believe that because of his resurrection all who trust in him share in that same resurrection hope. Fifth is \u201ceternal judgment.\u201d New Christians are to understand that eternity is at stake in their lives and in the lives of all people who will stand before the Lord in final judgment. These five things aren\u2019t all there is to faith. In fact, they aren\u2019t even all there is at the core, but the writer of Hebrews highlights them as a good starting point. Once these things are settled, it\u2019s time to move on. He says, \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We don\u2019t want to camp out just inside the gate. At the same time we need to master the basics before we can move on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Christianity 101 Hebrews 6: The basic foundational truths are in place.
