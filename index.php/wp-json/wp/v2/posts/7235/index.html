The people look like mere ants.<br \/>\nIn this passage Isaiah pictures for us the God of Creation.  This is the God who &#8220;scooped up the ocean in his two hands&#8221; and measured out the mountains.  This God calls the stars by name and sits high above the earth, so distant that the inhabitants of this world look like &#8220;mere ants.&#8221;  The purpose of this passage isn\u2019t to teach what I\u2019ve heard called &#8220;worm theology&#8221; in which the human race is viewed as insignificant and worthless.  After all, once those oceans are created and the mountains put in place, God turns his attention to making us, and when he finishes he\u2019s pleased with the results.  This portion of this passage isn&#8217;t about putting humanity in its place.  Instead, it\u2019s about lifting our Creator to his place!  We aren&#8217;t talking about a tin god here; this is the God of the Universe, Maker of all.  This King isn\u2019t the ruler of some little country off in some forgotten part of the world.  No king or idol holds a candle to this Creator-God.  I can never fully comprehend him but I can worship him.  This passage is a reminder of the greatness of God and a call to humbly bow before him.<br \/>\nTake Away:  I can never fully comprehend him but I can worship him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God of Creation Isaiah 40: God sits high above the round ball of earth.
