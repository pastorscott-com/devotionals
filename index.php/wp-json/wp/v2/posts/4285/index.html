Instead, though, I\u2019d rather just be reminded here of the good will God has toward us.  We don\u2019t hear Moses saying to the priests, \u201cLet\u2019s make it our habit to ask God to bless us.\u201d  Instead, here&#8217;s God, Himself, saying, \u201cI want to bless you and as a reminder of that, here\u2019s what I want you to say.\u201d  Thank you, Lord, for not only your blessings, but for your desire to bless.<br \/>\nTake Away: We are recipients of an abundance of good will from the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bless you!
