He\u2019s right on target in how he oversees the legal system of his kingdom. His judicial appointees are charged by the king to take their work seriously, reminding them that ultimately they must give an account of themselves to the Lord. Jehoshaphat gives a similar charge to those given authority over Temple business. They\u2019re to be dependable and honest in all they do. Jehoshaphat\u2019s bottom line to these powerful people is this: \u201cGod be with you as you do your best.\u201d One reminder I see in this passage is that God expects me to give my best to the responsibilities that are mine. Positions of authority carry with them an equal portion of accountability. Also, I see that my best is all that I can give. Even when it\u2019s not really good enough I can\u2019t do any better than my best. When I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ve come to the end of myself and I\u2019ve done all the Lord expects of me. At that point, my best may be seen as acceptable by others or it may be time for me to move on, handing the responsibility over to someone else, but I have no reason to be ashamed when I\u2019ve given all I have to give. Finally, though, there\u2019s good news here. God\u2019s help is promised. When I\u2019ve done all I can do and, frankly, it isn\u2019t enough, rather than coming to the end, I might just come to the beginning; that is, the beginning of God. He delights in taking unlikely people and using them to accomplish great things like killing giants or feeding thousands. It\u2019s pretty cool. I bring my best to the table, as meager as that might be, and then God steps in, lifting me and what I have to offer to dizzying new heights. Rather than ending up humbly handing the keys over to some more capable person, I sometimes find myself amazed at what God has done.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord delights in using unlikely people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God takes my best and makes it better 2 Chronicles 19: And God be with you as you do your best.
