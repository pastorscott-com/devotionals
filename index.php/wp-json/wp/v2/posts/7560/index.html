Here I see that it will be 200 years before Daniel has his adventures in distant Babylonia.  I find myself back in the day of Isaiah and his warnings of future destruction and here I find God at work, reaching out to a rebellious people in an effort to restore them to him and spare them from what&#8217;s coming otherwise.  Also, as I reach the book of Hosea I find I&#8217;m now in the final segment of the Old Testament in the writings of those called the &#8220;minor prophets.&#8221;   Of course, it isn&#8217;t their message that&#8217;s &#8220;minor.&#8221;  It&#8217;s just that their books are shorter and more focused.   All the books of the Minor Prophets together contain less material than, say, the book of Ezekiel.  Hosea&#8217;s prophecy is called a &#8220;living parable.&#8221;  As will Ezekiel in years to come, Hosea is called to live out his message.  His prophecy is also a love story.  The love he demonstrates for us is not some silly, &#8220;love ya&#8217; man&#8221; or a shallow, &#8220;baby, I need your lovin'&#8221; kind of love.  Hosea demonstrates for us the depth and power of God&#8217;s love for us.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord loves us with a powerful, persisting love.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The living parable Hosea 1: This is God&#8217;s Message to Hosea.
