Things are about to get bad, with huge events coming to earth, each announced by the blast of a trumpet. The sober nature of these events is underscored as a foreboding silence falls in heaven. Before that first trumpet blast John sees an angel carrying a gold censer. The scene in heaven is one of worship at the Temple and the angel with the censor is in the role of priest. The offering, made with incense, is the prayers of God\u2019s people. Even as the judgment of God is about to be poured out on the earth, the prayers of his people are heard. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot going on in this passage and Bible scholars are pressed to the limit to explain all the symbolism. I don\u2019t claim to have any deep insight into the meaning here. However, I do note that before bad things ever start happening that God\u2019s people are praying and that he\u2019s listening to their prayers. While I doubt that the purpose of this passage is to encourage prayer I do see here an example of the importance of it. Of course we should pray when \u201csomething like a huge mountain\u2026is flung into the sea\u201d of our lives. However, it\u2019s a good idea to already do some praying before such earth shaking events (literally in this case) start happening. God\u2019s people need to pray before, during, and after unwelcome life events.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Prayer matters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When\u2019s the best time to pray?
