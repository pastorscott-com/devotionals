As a powerful king he has all the resources necessary for this experiment.  He builds exquisite palaces and gardens, acquires an army of servants, amasses enormous wealth, and fills his life with beautiful women.  He reports, &#8220;Everything I wanted I took.&#8221;  Many people at least attempt this approach to happiness, although few have the resources to pull it off.  Because of that, they remain convinced that just a little more of this or that will do the trick.  They think that once they arrive at that point they\u2019ll be truly satisfied.  Solomon, though, does have it all.  Not only that, he goes into this experiment with his eyes wide open.  His verdict?  Solomon says it\u2019s all like collecting smoke.  He\u2019s left empty and even dejected.  He says he worked hard at making it all happen, expecting to arrive at a place of personal happiness and satisfaction.  &#8220;Surely,&#8221; he thought to himself, &#8220;just one more palace, just another million dollars, just the right woman and everything will come together.&#8221;  However, he ends up thinking it\u2019s all a waste of time.   In spite of this ancient verdict of Solomon, we still tend to believe the big lie that not only is pleasure the answer, but that it\u2019s all there really is to life.  It\u2019s no wonder that &#8220;taking up the cross&#8221; is such a foreign language to us.<br \/>\nTake Away: Happiness isn\u2019t found in possessions.  It can only be found by the way of the cross.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Experimenting on oneself Ecclesiastes 2: I said to myself, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go for it &#8212; experiment with pleasure, have a good time.&#8221; One of the experiments of Solomon is to see if pleasure produces lasting happiness.
