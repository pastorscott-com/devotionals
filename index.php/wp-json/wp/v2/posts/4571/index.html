It has to do with David&#8217;s confidence, his rushing to, in the eyes of common sense, disaster.   There\u2019s no trace of hesitancy here.  This isn&#8217;t one of those reluctant &#8220;well, someone has to do it, it might as well be me&#8221; situations.  David\u2019s eager for this fight.  The mental picture is powerful.  On one hand, big old Goliath, armed to the teeth, stands there spewing out promises of death.  On the other, young David armed only with a sling, proclaims God&#8217;s authority, running toward this giant of a man.  Within seconds Goliath lies face down in the dirt and David stands over him, with Goliath&#8217;s own sword in hand, preparing to chop off his head.  It was never about the brashness of youth, or David&#8217;s &#8220;secret weapon.&#8221;  Everything here carries the mark of God at work.  David acted with confidence because he had heard the voice of God in his life.  Not only had he heard, he had believed.   A realization of this truth is not only good for combat with giants &#8212; it\u2019s good for everyday life too.  I need to spend enough time with God that I can clearly hear him, and then, having heard, to believe, and having believed, to act with confidence.<br \/>\nTake Away: Once you\u2019ve heard a certain word from the Lord you can move forward in absolute confidence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hearing, believing, acting 1 Samuel 17: David took off from the front line, running toward the Philistine.
