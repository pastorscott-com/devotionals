As Moses organizes these hundreds of thousands of people we read page after page of names and numbers.  In fact, the Lord even gives Moses a list of the names of those who are to name the names in accomplishing this huge task.  It\u2019s all very practical and reasonable.  If nothing else, Numbers reminds us that our service of the Lord isn\u2019t all about worship services and sermons.   Often there are practical things to be done: statistics to be compiled, organizational meetings to attend, and plans to be made.  Such endeavors don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d very spiritual but they\u2019re part of forming mere humans into a people of God, organized and ready to serve.  Having said all that, I confess that I don\u2019t find much devotional material in the lists of the Book of Numbers.  I may fast forward through them and focus on some of the other events of this book of the Bible.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes being a people of God includes taking care of business in addition to focusing on worship and other \u201cspiritual\u201d activities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A book of the Bible that really counts Numbers 1: Number the congregation The book of Numbers may be the most accurately named book of the Bible.
