Now, like a shooting star, he&#8217;s just as quickly fading from the scene as all attention is focused on a new \u201cSun\u201d rising, shedding light, not just for a passing moment but for all time.  John\u2019s disciples are defensive about this.  They believe in and support him and they don\u2019t like it that his role is diminishing as Jesus is drawing more and more attention.  For John, though, this is exactly how it should be.  As he said when he introduced Jesus, Jesus is vastly superior to himself.  As Jesus moves into the limelight John happily stands off on the sidelines cheering him on.  I think there\u2019s a spiritual parallel to this in the lives of those on the Christian journey.  Once I acknowledge Jesus as the Savior of the world and as my personal Savior, it quickly becomes apparent that this Savior is also King of kings and Lord of lords.  I understand that I need to stop being the center of my universe so that he can move to his rightful place as Lord of my life.
