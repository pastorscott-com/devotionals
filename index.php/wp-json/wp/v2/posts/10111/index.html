From the establishment of the Church years earlier, Christians have been wonderfully generous. That\u2019s true concerning their relationship with outsiders but even truer of their relationship with one another. The Church is like a family with each person valued, loved, and cared for. Some are more materially blessed than others but in blessing some the Lord has blessed all. However, that mutuality has drawn some to their number who come to get rather than to share. This, apparently, has been a problem from the beginning. Paul reminds them that twenty years earlier when he was their pastor that he set an example of pulling his share of the load and also had a rule in place that everyone else did the same. This was such an important concept that Paul sat an example: working his fingers to the bone for the church and then moonlighting to help with the expenses of the church. It\u2019s a balancing act in which those who have genuine needs are cared for but at the same time those who won\u2019t do their part are encouraged to do so. It\u2019s a challenge for the Thessalonians and it\u2019s a change for the church today. On one hand, we have \u201cno work, no eat.\u201d On the other hand we have the instruction to not \u201ctreat him as an enemy.\u201d The Apostle tells them to sit down with such a person and explain to them that we may not all be able to contribute an equal amount but we can all do whatever it is that we can do. Allowing people to be freeloaders in the church (and, I think in society as well) isn\u2019t doing them a favor.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We need the wisdom of the Lord to show compassion to those who need a helping hand and at the same time insist people do what they are capable of doing to care for themselves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dealing with freeloaders 2Thessalonians 3: If you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat.
