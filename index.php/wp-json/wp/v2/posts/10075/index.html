The day&#8217;s coming, he says, when these \u201ctents\u201d (that is our earthly bodies) will shut down and be replaced by bodies of heavenly construction.  The weaknesses we deal with every day even to the point that we come to think of them as ordinary and acceptable will be gone forever, replaced by that which is amazingly superior.  Paul says that we get just a taste of what it will be like as we enjoy the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  As good as that is, it\u2019s just a small sample of what\u2019s coming.  With such exciting prospects you\u2019d think that that\u2019s what Paul would think about all the time and that if he\u2019s asked what motivates him his answer will focus on making the big move from the \u201ctent to the palace.\u201d  Make no mistake; he likes thinking about it all.  However, the big deal for him isn\u2019t \u201cexile or homecoming.\u201d  Rather, he declares, the big thing is pleasing God in all his life.  His greatest motivation is the knowledge that there\u2019s a way to live in this life that\u2019s pleasing to God.  There\u2019s a possibility of standing before the Lord and hearing him say \u201cwell done.\u201d  For Paul, the big deal isn\u2019t pie in the sky as much as it\u2019s pleasing the Father in this life.  Going to heaven is huge, no doubt about it.  However, pleasing the Lord, our Creator and Master, according to Paul, is even bigger.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: When we live to please the Lord we\u2019re living as we were designed to live.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our number one motivation 2Corinthians 5: Cheerfully pleasing God is the main thing.
