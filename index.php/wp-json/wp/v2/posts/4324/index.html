I\u2019ve just read two whole chapters about such events.  There\u2019s the weekly Sabbath plus several annual celebrations.  These festivals always include making sacrifices that the Lord gives back to the people.  In other words, a lamb is given as a sacrifice, but part of it is given back to the one making the sacrifice.  In this, we see the Lord joining them in the celebration!  I think this is very neat!  God says, \u201cOkay, I have another rule for you: on the first day of the seventh month each year, take a vacation, bring offerings to the Temple and let\u2019s enjoy one another\u2019s company for a week.\u201d  This is an element of my relationship with the Lord that I need to remember.
