It\u2019s highly unlikely.  However, I believe God, the Holy Spirit knew it.  The last two paragraphs of Malachi are an excellent ending for the Old Testament.  For those of that day, still living under the Law, one of the last words is \u201cremember.\u201d  They\u2019re to keep the \u201crules and procedures for right living\u201d given them by Moses.  If they do that they\u2019ll have done what the Lord requires of them.  However, there\u2019s another last word.  It\u2019s, \u201calso look ahead.\u201d  The Lord isn\u2019t finished working out redemption for them and all that has happened thus far has prepared the way for the really big deal that\u2019s yet to come.  As the curtain&#8217;s falling on this, the first act we\u2019re told that the next act is going to be both interesting and surprising.  They\u2019ll know it\u2019s starting when Elijah shows up to usher it in.  For the people of Israel, that\u2019s a long 400 years distant in the future.  As for me, all I have to do is turn the page to see what has, up to now, been the black and white picture of God\u2019s salvation plan displayed in living color.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even to this day we are wise to obediently remember what the Lord has told us while at the same time look forward to what he has promised us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The curtain falls, but Act II is about to begin Malachi 4: Remember and keep the revelation I gave through my servant Moses.
