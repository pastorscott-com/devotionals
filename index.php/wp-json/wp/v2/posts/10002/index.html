He and his disciples are in the Upper Room and Jesus is in the role of servant, washing their feet.  He comes to Peter, but Peter resists, declaring \u201cYou\u2019re not going to wash my feet \u2013 ever!\u201d  Jesus, though, persists telling Peter that if he won\u2019t allow this that he\u2019ll have no part in what Jesus has come to do.  Peter decides to give in, but if that\u2019s how it is, he has a better idea.  He wants Jesus to wash his hands and head as well.  Once again, our Lord holds steady, explaining that it\u2019s foot washing that Peter needs and it\u2019s foot washing that he\u2019s going to get.  Then, the meal ended, Jesus tenderly commands his disciples to love one another.  This, he says, will be their primary, distinguishing characteristic.  As Jesus is stating these words, Peter\u2019s focus is on what Jesus said earlier.  He ignores the teaching concerning mutual love and wants to know where Jesus is going.  The Lord patiently responds, telling Peter that someday he\u2019ll follow but not right now.  Peter is having none of that.  \u201cWhy later?  Why not now?\u201d he demands.  Then he adds, \u201cI\u2019ll lay down my life for you.\u201d  At this point, Jesus has had enough of Peter\u2019s approach.  Even as he declares his allegiance to the Lord his responses are always that he knows better than Jesus.  At this point Jesus tells him that big time failure is coming to him, and soon.  I don\u2019t know whether to smile at Peter\u2019s \u201cLord, I love you but I know better than you\u201d approach or if I should wince and remember the times I\u2019ve blundered ahead of the Lord thinking I knew what to do without asking him.  How often do my actions betray the truth that I think I know better than God?<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: A part of following Jesus is admitting that he\u2019s smarter than we are.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Peter, stop arguing!
