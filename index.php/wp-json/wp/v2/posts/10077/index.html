It\u2019s clear the there are some sick situations there and that this church is far from being a healthy congregation.  The Corinthian church isn\u2019t a prototype of what a Christian church is supposed to look like, although how Paul deals with them is a primer on how a spiritual leader is to deal with a difficult church situation.  An insight in this passage is that as Paul writes to Corinth he knows the impact his words will have on the church.  Beyond that, his words impact him as well.  Administrating this strong medicine is painful for Paul too.  The old \u201cthis hurts me more than it hurts you\u201d line is literally true in this situation.  Paul gets no pleasure in writing to his friends at Corinth as he does.  He\u2019s frustrated with them and somewhat fearful for them.  Still, he expects his strong medicine to bring about, in the long run, good results.  Sometimes parents have to be disciplinarians.  It would be nice to always feel warm and fuzzy about things but to do so isn\u2019t what real love is like.  In his first letter Paul steps up to the plate, telling them the facts of spiritual life even though, in his words, \u201cI felt awful at the time.\u201d  Sometimes preachers have to be disciplinarians.  As it is for Paul and as it is for parents, proper discipline should never carry with it a sense of pleasure in causing pain.  I imagine tearstains on the parchment that contains what we think of as 1 Corinthians.  In the same way, there should be tearstains on the sermon notes of a pastor who preaches a sermon that will cause some pain.  Otherwise, that sermon should never be preached.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Sometimes discipline must be done but it should never be done with pleasure.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tearstained letters 2Corinthians 7: I know I distressed you greatly with my letter.
