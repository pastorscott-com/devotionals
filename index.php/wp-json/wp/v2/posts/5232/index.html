He\u2019s watched his father, David, lead Israel for many years.  Then when he becomes King he asks God for wisdom that he might lead His people.  In all this he comes to understand leadership dynamics as well as anyone who ever lived.  In the passage before me today I get just a taste of his philosophy of leadership.  The guy who says these things isn\u2019t some pastor with an all-volunteer staff of church people who might just walk off if they don\u2019t like the way things are going.  Rather, he\u2019s King of Israel.  He has &#8220;off with their heads&#8221; authority.  In other words, if he wants he can order the direction and everyone has to follow.  However, Solomon has learned that dictatorship isn\u2019t leadership.  He says his job is to motivate people to move together in positive directions.  He says he isn&#8217;t supposed to promise what can&#8217;t be delivered and he isn&#8217;t to get people to do what he wants just to get something for himself.  Honesty, unselfishness, persuasiveness &#8212; these are leadership qualities Solomon brings to my attention today.<br \/>\nTake Away: Dictatorship isn\u2019t leadership.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leadership, not dictatorship Proverbs 16: A good leader motivates, doesn&#8217;t mislead, doesn&#8217;t exploit.
