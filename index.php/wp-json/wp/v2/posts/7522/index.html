Wrong!  Truth be told, Nebuchadnezzar hasn&#8217;t a clue.  He takes Daniel&#8217;s dream interpretation and goes right out to build a statue of himself, based on that dream.  He then demands that everyone, including those who worship the Master of all kings, bow down to him instead.  I&#8217;m telling you he&#8217;s clueless!  The dream episode impacts Nebuchadnezzar and in that his attitude concerning God Almighty changes.  However, his application of this new knowledge is skewed and greatly lacking.  In fact, he&#8217;s years away from anything close to a humble relationship with his Creator.  I&#8217;ve seen it in people&#8217;s lives.  A person prays the sinner&#8217;s prayer and receives Christ and then, within two weeks does something so ill advised that I can hardly believe it.  At one time I would have concluded that they had &#8220;back slid.&#8221;  However, I&#8217;ve come to realize that, while it&#8217;s true that some have &#8220;looked back&#8221; others are still in the process of becoming believers.  They aren&#8217;t sure what it means to follow Jesus, so they do silly stuff and stumble along, putting their spiritual lives in great jeopardy.  Nebuchadnezzar has made a big move in declaring Daniel&#8217;s God the God of all gods.  However, he&#8217;s a long way from what that God of all gods wants to accomplish in his life.  In fact, his journey has only begun.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for the crisis moments, but at the same time, recognize that they are but stepping stones in a longer journey.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First steps of a long journey Daniel 2: Your God is beyond question the God of all gods, the Master of all kings.
