In an off handed remark I asked, \u201cHave you asked the Lord about it?\u201d  His response was, \u201cOh, the Lord understands.\u201d  Later, I found myself thinking about the exchange in view of my own life.  How often do I do whatever I want to do with the attitude: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, the Lord understands.\u201d  Tell you what; I don\u2019t treat my wife that way.  When I\u2019m thinking about taking some out of the ordinary action I talk it over with her.  Most of the time I could probably go ahead and she would \u201cunderstand\u201d but the thing is that we have a relationship with one another that includes our respecting each other and valuing one another\u2019s opinions on things.  Surely, I should have a similar respectful, intimate relationship with the Lord.  There\u2019s a place for prayers along the lines of, \u201cLord, I\u2019m thinking about doing this, what do you think?\u201d  The Apostle says he gave up a lot of stuff that he might have a personal relationship with Jesus.  If I want to have a vital, real, living relationship with Jesus one of the things I must give up is having a self-willed, presumptive attitude toward him.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Do we treat the Lord as a real person or as some abstract idea?<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What does it mean to have a genuine relationship with Christ?
