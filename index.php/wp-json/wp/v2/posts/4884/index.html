He must lead Israel and he must build a Temple for the worship of Jehovah God.  David wants his son to know that God is utterly dependable.  Others will deliberately or accidentally let him down but God remains faithful all the way.  With that in mind David wants Solomon to put his weight fully and firmly on his God, and for him to keep it there.  That&#8217;s good advice to a young man who\u2019s about to become king but it is also good advice for you and for me.  Everything and everyone else in life is destined to disappoint us sooner or later.  Only the Lord is fully trustworthy.  If I look anywhere else, I\u2019ll find plenty of reasons to be anxious and discouraged.  In the Lord I find my Rock.<br \/>\nTake Away: We need to pass our faith on to our children \u2013 they will need it just as much as we\u2019ve needed it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the solid rock I stand 1 Chronicles 28: Don&#8217;t be anxious or get discouraged.
