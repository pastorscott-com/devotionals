He doesn&#8217;t understand why his children died in a terrible storm, or why his considerable wealth was taken away on that same day.  He doesn&#8217;t understand why he\u2019s suffering so and he doesn&#8217;t understand why he was ever born in the first place.  One biggie is that he doesn&#8217;t understand why God won&#8217;t answer his plea for a hearing to straighten out this whole mess.  There isn&#8217;t much solid ground for Job these days.  So much of what he has thought of as firm has slipped away, including what he believes about God and how the Lord works in the world.  In fact, there remains just one place of solid footing.  It\u2019s here that he takes his stand: &#8220;I know that God lives.&#8221;  Thankfully, few people in history have faced the tragedy and loss Job did.  However, for all of us, the day comes as we near our last breath when we\u2019re left with only the bare essentials.  On that day, I pray that I, too, will find that one remaining firm place to take my stand: &#8220;I know that God lives.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: When we come to the crucial moments of life we have to decide what is and isn\u2019t essential.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our final refuge Job 19: Still, I know that God lives.
