He\u2019s already a living legend among the Christians.  For over twenty years he\u2019s been faithful through thick and thin, through good days and bad.  Actually, he doesn\u2019t label \u201cgood and bad\u201d as most people do.  Right now he\u2019s in jail and you\u2019d think he\u2019d call that \u201cbad.\u201d  Instead, he happily explains that his being locked up has resulted in a lot of good things.  People who wouldn\u2019t have heard the gospel otherwise have literally come to him asking him to tell them about Jesus.  Others, who&#8217;ve been timid about their faith before have been inspired by his faithfulness and have stepped forward to tell others about the Lord.  A few have mistakenly concluded that with Paul locked up there\u2019s a leadership void and are trying to fill his shoes, preaching about the Lord in hopes of gaining a leadership foothold in the church.  That last group causes the great Apostle to reflect a bit on what it\u2019s all about.  Obviously, he doesn\u2019t want false teachers out there preaching a false gospel.  However, these folks, he\u2019s concluded, are on target with their preaching and are only off target with their ambitions.  Paul\u2019s conclusion is that that stuff doesn\u2019t matter as long as the gospel&#8217;s being preached.  I can\u2019t help but be impressed by Paul\u2019s mature, focused attitude here.  He\u2019s willing to give up his freedom and his reputation if it serves to advance the cause of Christ.  I\u2019m reminded today that the Lord can accomplish great things through a person who doesn\u2019t necessarily need to get the credit for what&#8217;s done.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We do our best, leaving the results in the hands of the Lord.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Watching others preach the gospel Philippians 1: I\u2019ve decided that I really don\u2019t care about their motives.
