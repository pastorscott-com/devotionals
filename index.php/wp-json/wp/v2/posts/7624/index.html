He says he can\u2019t stand their meetings, conferences, and conventions.  He washes his hands of their projects and goals and he says he can\u2019t stand their singing which is more focused on what they like than on him.  This message may be buried deep in the Minor Prophets but it should be right at the top of our concerns as Christians who go to church each Sunday.  It isn\u2019t that their services and conferences should be discontinued and it isn\u2019t that their projects aren\u2019t worthwhile.  Also, this is no call to change the music style of the church (whatever it may be).  It is, though, a powerful reminder of what (better stated, \u201cWho\u201d) it&#8217;s all about.  The Lord says that what they&#8217;re doing is worthless, not because it&#8217;s worthless activity, but because they&#8217;re ignoring him and his purposes for their lives.  God states, \u201cDo you know what I want?  I want justice \u2013 oceans of it.  I want fairness \u2013 rivers of it.  That\u2019s all I want.\u201d  If I refuse God\u2019s priority of caring for the poor, of helping the one who&#8217;s down and out then God will refuse my acts of worship.  Maybe this passage needs to be read before we have our church planning meetings!<br \/>\nTake Away: If we\u2019re missing the Lord\u2019s priorities for the church the other things we do aren\u2019t worth much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worshiping to please the right Person Amos 5: When was the last time you sang to me?
