I can&#8217;t help but wonder how Hosea went about obeying God&#8217;s command.  Did he head down to the red light district and pick a wife?  Did he already know Gomer from their childhoods and, maybe remembered a childhood crush he had on her?  This situation almost begs for more information.  Frankly, I doubt that Gomer is a lovely lady at all.  Instead, I think she\u2019s hard and brittle and jaded and rebellious.  The reason I think that is not because I think all women who sell their bodies are like that.  I think many are victims for whom one bad choice has led to another.  Rather, I see Gomer thus because in this &#8220;living parable&#8221; she represents the rebellious people of Israel.  I don&#8217;t think that Hosea goes out and picks the prettiest of the lot.  Instead, I think he picks the person whose most like Israel: hard, brittle, jaded, and in rebellion against their loving God.  Obviously, such a marriage is doomed from the start.  However, in spite of this oil and water marriage, Hosea finds himself bound to his wife by an irresistible, undeniable love.  The reason for this is that, in this living parable Gomer represents Israel; Hosea represents God.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is bound to us in love, but not because we\u2019re irresistibly loveable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picking a wife Hosea 1: He picked Gomer daughter of Diblaim.
