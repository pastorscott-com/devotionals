He\u2019s spent 40 years living apart from his own people, tending sheep.  The idea of running into God out there in the wilderness must be the farthest thing from his mind.  He sees smoke on the horizon and goes to investigate.  As he gets closer he sees that it\u2019s just a lonely bush that\u2019s ablaze.  The thing is, the fire isn\u2019t consuming the bush and has a source of fuel that Moses can\u2019t see.  He\u2019s about to find out that the bush is ablaze with the presence of the Lord.  I doubt that Moses thought about it, but that bush is doing the very opposite of what he did.  When he was younger he burned with compassion for his enslaved kin.  However, these years in the wilderness have quenched that fire.  Unlike the bush that keeps on burning, he settled for a life in exile, leaving his fellow Hebrews in slavery in Egypt.  When I act on my own, doing what I think is a good idea, I tend to run out of energy.  After all, I\u2019m drawing on my talents and abilities and it doesn\u2019t take long for me to run dry.  However, when I live in the Lord and allow his Holy Spirit to be my Guide and my Source, well, I\u2019ve tapped into the Power Source that\u2019s never exhausted.  Lord, let the fire of your Presence burn in my heart today.<br \/>\nTake Away: If I\u2019m going to be used of God I need to allow him to be my power source, otherwise I\u2019m bound to fail.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Burning bush Exodus 3: The bush was blazing away but it didn\u2019t burn up.
