And not just his ancestors, Paul, himself, starts off here. Then, out in the wilderness on the road to Damascus he has a personal, transforming encounter with the Lord that forever changes his life. Never again will he base his relationship with God on what was written on stone tablets hundreds of years earlier. Now, his relationship with the Lord is just that: a relationship. He doesn\u2019t have to check a rulebook to know how things are between him and God. Rather, he enjoys a personal, intimate relationship with his Creator. This \u201cface to face\u201d level of faith is what the Apostle wants for his friends at Corinth and it\u2019s what the Lord wants to have with you and me. Listen, don\u2019t ever settle for a book of rules when you can personally know God. That\u2019s the offer he makes to us in Christ, who not only came to die for us, but also came to live with and in us in the Person of the Holy Spirit. For Christians, the Bible isn\u2019t a book of rules to be followed. Rather, it\u2019s a map that leads us to God and then helps us live in his personal presence.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Don\u2019t settle for rules when the reality of God in your heart is abundantly available in Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My close, personal Friend 2Corinthians 3: God is a living, personal presence, not a piece of chiseled stone.
