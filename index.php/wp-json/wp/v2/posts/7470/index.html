In this passage Ezekiel expresses the Lord&#8217;s condemnation of the religious leaders who have utterly failed to minister to the people of God.  These leaders, Ezekiel says, are like predatory shepherds who care only for themselves and use the sheep to their own ends.  Here in America we know all about predatory clergy as disgusting stories of immoral and predatory behavior have rocked the Church.  Sometimes it&#8217;s clear that the secular media loves to pick on Christianity, but in this case the actions and the cover up needs to be exposed to light.  How many people have grown up with a distrust of God and the Church because of the failure of these awful shepherds?  Ezekiel describes the flock as &#8220;scattered,&#8221; &#8220;exposed&#8221; and &#8220;vulnerable.&#8221;  He tells us that the Lord will judge these predatory shepherds and then, he&#8217;ll turn his attention to the broken ones.  He, personally, will be their shepherd.  &#8220;I will bring them back&#8221; he promises.  I fear that sometimes we &#8220;church people&#8221; are too hard on those who are living self-destructive lives.  Each one has a story that, yes, may include personal failure (the Lord says he&#8217;s &#8220;stepping in and judging between one sheep and another&#8221;).  However, some folks have had plenty of help in messing up their lives.  Much of the blame may go to some authority figure like a parent, teacher, and, sadly, even a pastor who failed them either intentionally or by neglect.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sadly, some folks have had plenty of help in messing up their lives and stand in need of a second chance more than condemnation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God loves even broken people Ezekiel 34: From now on, I myself am the shepherd.
