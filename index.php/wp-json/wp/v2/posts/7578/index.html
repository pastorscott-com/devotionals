I see myself as the &#8220;tax collector&#8221; who prays for mercy, the servant who invests his talent, and the woman who finds the lost coin. It&#8217;s only when I&#8217;m willing to see myself from the less than stellar point of view that the parable can truly instruct me and help me become the person God would have me be.  Since Hosea&#8217;s story is a living parable, who am I in this story?  I know that the primary focus is on God and the ancient Israelites, but if I read this story devotionally who am I?  It has to be Gomer.  She&#8217;s a pitiful figure in the story.  Her origins are unknown to us, but she&#8217;s both a victim and a trespasser.  Even when she&#8217;s given a second chance at life she blows it, making a bigger mess than she had in the first place.  She&#8217;s stubborn and deeply flawed and, seemingly not worth redemption.  Hosea, though, loves her so much that he can&#8217;t do what common sense dictates.  He waded into the filth and got her the first time, and, when she betrays him and returns to it, he wades in again.  As I read this I&#8217;m not to say, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m like Hosea, and I&#8217;ll be gracious and kind and forgiving&#8221; (although, I&#8217;m supposed to be all of these things).  Instead, I&#8217;m to say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been like Gomer.  In spite of God&#8217;s goodness to me I&#8217;ve been hard-headed and hard-hearted.  God has not only rescued me, but he&#8217;s waded out into sin to bring me back when I&#8217;ve failed.&#8221;  If I refuse to identify with Gomer in this story it will never have the impact on my life it&#8217;s intended to have.<br \/>\nTake Away: The parables work best when I rightly identify myself in them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Identifying with the right person Hosea 3: From now on you&#8217;re living with me.
