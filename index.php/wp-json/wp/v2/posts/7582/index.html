She&#8217;s left him but he isn&#8217;t over her and wants her to come back.  However, he knows that just getting her back won&#8217;t be enough.  For her to return yet remain unchanged will only start this whole destructive sequence over again.  Something in her has to change if there&#8217;s any hope for their future together.  That, Hosea says, is how it is between God and his people.  The Lord loves them and wants them to turn from their idol worshiping ways and return to him.  However, what he wants from them isn&#8217;t just a polished approach to doing worship.  Instead, he wants them to love him with the abandon and passion that he has for them.  He says to them, &#8220;I&#8217;m after love that lasts, not more religion.&#8221;  As old as this concept is, and as reasonable as it is, people to this very day fail to grasp this.  God doesn&#8217;t want me to go to church; to &#8220;practice religion,&#8221; or to attend Bible studies.  He wants me to passionately love him.  He wants me to throw myself into that relationship without reservation.  When that happens, no one has to tell me I ought to worship and pray and study my Bible.  The only reason for me to go to church and study my Bible is that in doing these things I better experience the Object of my strongest attraction: God, Himself.  That&#8217;s the kind of relationship God wants to have with me and with you.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord wants us to passionately love him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unreservedly in love with God Hosea 6: I want you to know God, not go to more prayer meetings.
