He has a hard time understanding how a puny man&#8217;s sins can impact the Almighty.  Now that&#8217;s an interesting question!  If God is merely sitting on his throne making up rules for me to follow this argument has some merit.  Job, though, underestimates the relational intimacy the Lord wants to have with us.  He doesn\u2019t want to be far above me, looking down from heavenly realms, keeping his distance.  Rather, he wants to live in me and through me. When he created me, he made me in his own image.  Now, even though that image is marred, there remains something of God in me.  If this is true, and the Lord has connected me to his life then my sin will touch him in a direct way.  Sin not only destroys my relationship with God but it actually wounds him.  Now, I don\u2019t intend to be too hard on Job at this point.  After all, I have one big advantage Job doesn&#8217;t have.  I can turn to the New Testament Gospels and watch God being touched by sin as Jesus hangs on a cross.  For God our sin is more than our firing B-B\u2019s at a Battleship and it\u2019s more than an academic issue.<br \/>\nTake Away: Because the Lord connects us directly to his life, we actually have the ability to cause him pain or bring him pleasure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>B-B\u2019s and Battleships Job 7: Even suppose I&#8217;d sinned &#8212; how would that hurt you?
