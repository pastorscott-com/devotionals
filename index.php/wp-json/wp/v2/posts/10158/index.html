One letter then provides balance to the other. Christians aren\u2019t to be gullible and stupid as we live in a world that has more than its share of wicked, predatory people. At the same time we aren\u2019t to be so afraid or so calloused that we lose sight of what it means to be people of God who model our lives after one who \u201cwent about doing good.\u201d Apparently that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to one man who&#8217;s mentioned by John in this letter. Diotrephes, who \u201cloves being in charge\u201d learned the don\u2019t-be-gullible lesson so well that he forgot the practice-hospitality lesson. In Gaius, then, we meet a man who\u2019s found the middle way and his hospitality to God\u2019s people prompts the writing of this short letter. One of the challenges of the Christian life is avoiding the extremes mentioned in this letter and finding the balance where we \u201cmodel the good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christians have to find the balance between being easy targets of those who take unfair advantage of others and, at the same time, being caring, compassionate people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finding the middle road 3John : Model the good.
