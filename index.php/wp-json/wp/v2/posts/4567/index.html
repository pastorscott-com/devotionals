Being given the king&#8217;s own helmet and sword is an honor for David.  However, in spite of the seriousness of the situation, the result is comical.  The helmet&#8217;s way too big, the sword, when strapped around his waist, drags the ground.   The oversized armor weighs David down to the point that he can hardly move much less fight.  Thus we come to the truism that we each must wear our own armor.  We individualist Westerners can really get off on this one!  &#8220;I have to do this my way&#8230;what works for you won&#8217;t necessarily work for me&#8230;after all, I can&#8217;t wear someone else&#8217;s armor.&#8221;  Let&#8217;s step back for a minute and look at this situation again.  Saul&#8217;s armor, including his weapons of war aren\u2019t suitable for David so David simply picks another approach that already belongs to someone else.  We don&#8217;t know who invented the sling, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t David.  Probably way back in the first pages of Genesis there&#8217;s an untold story about how some enterprising fellow came up with the sling as a way to hunt.  When wars came along the sling became one of the weapons every soldier attempted to master.  So, when David rejects Saul&#8217;s &#8220;armor&#8221; he is actually accepting that of someone else.  I think that it\u2019s rare for God to call us to be totally original.  After all, &#8220;there\u2019s nothing new under the sun.&#8221;  The Bible&#8217;s full of principles that can be applied to the issues of life.  Someone has already thought through ways to deal with most issues.  David didn&#8217;t go out and invent the sling so he could fight Goliath; he simply picked it as the method for accomplishing his purpose &#8212; a method pioneered by someone else.  The fact that David couldn&#8217;t fight in Saul&#8217;s armor doesn\u2019t give me permission to go around acting like the Lone Ranger doing everything my own way.   It just reminds me that there&#8217;s more than one way to accomplish things, and I need to know enough about the issue at hand, and to listen carefully enough to the voice of the Lord in my life, to pick the right one.<br \/>\nTake Away: A wise person has more than one tool at hand and that person knows which tool fits that particular situation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shopping for armor 1 Samuel 17: Then Saul outfitted David as a soldier in armor.
