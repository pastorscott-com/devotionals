And I didn\u2019t even know it.<br \/>\nJacob \u2013 that \u201cheel grasper\u201d has lived down to his name. He, with this help of his mother, fooled his father, Isaac, into granting him the precious blessing that rightfully belonged to his brother. Now, he\u2019s paying for it by having to get out of the country before Esau can get his hands on him. Alone in the night he has an unexpected encounter with God. In spite of his failure and lack of character God graciously renews to Jacob the promise he made to his grandfather, Abraham. Jacob awakes from his dream and says, \u201cGod was here, in this place \u2013 far from home, when I have done nothing but wrong, and when I am not thinking of him at all \u2013 he was here all the time.\u201d Jacob is not only on a long journey in distance, he\u2019s at the first step of a spiritual journey that will take decades. This \u201cheel\u201d has heard from God and while there\u2019s still more wrong than right about him this \u201cstairway vision\u201d marks the beginning of that spiritual journey. The story of Jacob\u2019s spiritual journey is more entertaining than most, but it does remind us of our own stories. I am glad today for God\u2019s grace \u2013 his unexpected, unearned, promising, and patient grace.<br \/>\nTake away: Thank God for grace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jacob\u2019s stairway vision Genesis 28: God was in this place \u2013 truly.
