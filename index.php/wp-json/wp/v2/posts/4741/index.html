In fact, he just might scare me a bit as a bigger-than-life prayer warrior and miracle worker. It\u2019s his humanity that draws me to him. This man prays down fire, out-runs chariots, and then, in fear, runs for his life out to the loneliness of the desert. It\u2019s here that he collapses in the shade of a bush and gives notice to God that he\u2019s ready to die. While I\u2019m in awe of his power on Mount Carmel I just feel sorry for him out here past Beersheba, alone in the desert. As I look at him here I see that he isn&#8217;t some kind of superman at all. He\u2019s an ordinary man who trusts God with all his heart and, in so doing, gets way out of his comfort zone! Doing all that stuff takes all his energy. Now, with nothing left, he first runs, then cries out to God that he\u2019s had enough. It\u2019s when I see that doing all these impressive things is terribly hard for this man that I more fully appreciate what he does.<br \/>\nTake Away: Spiritual giants are, in the end, ordinary people with an extraordinary trust in the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The sacrifice of spiritual power 1Kings 19: Exhausted, he fell asleep.
