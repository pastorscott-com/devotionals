If you do that\u2026then I\u2019ll do this.\u201d  To me the finest part of the blessing is God\u2019s promise to move into their neighborhood and stroll through their streets with them.  This is the Creator promising to be fully engaged with his Creation.  They wouldn\u2019t go to visit God down at the Tent of Meeting, and he wouldn\u2019t just make special appearances at big events like the Passover observance. This is the promise of continued fellowship with their Creator in all the affairs of life.  Amazingly, God wants to walk with us even before we\u2019re aware of him and certainly in spite of the truth that we\u2019re not worthy of such a relationship.  What we see promised here is fulfilled to a great extent in Jesus, Emmanuel, God-with-us.  It\u2019s further fulfilled when I receive the fullness of God, the Holy Spirit into my life.  It will be gloriously completed when I experience the last pages of the book of Revelation. Lord, make yourself at home in my life now, and then.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord invites me to an intimate, daily relationship with himself \u2013 what an honor!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s good news Leviticus 26: I\u2019ll set up my residence in your neighborhood\u2026I\u2019ll stroll through your streets.
