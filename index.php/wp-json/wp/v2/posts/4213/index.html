Soon, God, Himself, will write out the basics on tablets of stone.  To their credit, the people are ready.  They pledge themselves to obedience.  Now, you and I know that this isn\u2019t going to work out.  God\u2019s faithfulness to them will be contrasted by their failure to keep the Covenant. Still, God isn\u2019t setting them up to fail.  In this Covenant we see all the potential for success.  Their failure in breaking the Covenant is what stops the plan from being a success.  Hundreds of years later God will initiate another plan.  You know it: \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son\u2026.\u201d  Once again, and in an even more complete way, everything&#8217;s in place for success.  And, once again God\u2019s part is perfect.  In fact, he&#8217;s even gone so far as to provide us the grace to make the same commitment they made.
