God&#8217;s man, Jeremiah, already has a reputation for preaching gloom and doom messages and he\u2019s at it again.  This time he disrupts events at the Temple by telling the worshipers there that the Lord\u2019s going to destroy both the Temple and them.  It&#8217;s an understatement to say that they don&#8217;t like it.  Jeremiah finds himself the center of a riot.  Soon officials show up and they conduct court right on the spot.  Simply put, Jeremiah\u2019s life isn&#8217;t worth a nickel.  It\u2019s then that a respected man, Ahikam son of Shaphan, steps up.  He reminds the people of another gloom and doom prophet, Micah, who during the reign of Hezekiah preached such messages.  He also had many enemies but he wasn&#8217;t killed. It&#8217;s not that they\u2019re above that sort of thing.  Another prophet, Uriah, was hunted down and murdered because people didn&#8217;t like his message.  On this day, though, Ahikam&#8217;s defense wins Jeremiah his freedom.  Ahikam is an important man and on this day he brings his considerable weight to bear to save Jeremiah&#8217;s life.  His stepping in isn\u2019t likely the prudent thing to do, after all this is a mob we&#8217;re talking about.  However, he has power and he uses it to do the right thing whether or not it\u2019s popular to do so.  Sometimes we have to spend some of our leadership simply because it&#8217;s the right thing to do.  Position and authority are just fine, but only if they&#8217;re used for the right purposes.  I&#8217;m not an important person like Ahikam, but I do have some influence in some limited circumstances.  Am I spending it on things that really matter?<br \/>\nTake Away: Position and authority and leadership skills are to be used in positive ways \u2013 not just to get our own way about things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three cheers for Ahikam Jeremiah 26: Ahikam son of Shaphan stepped forward and took his side.
