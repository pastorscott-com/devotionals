Without question, they have the corner of God.  Hadn\u2019t Moses been called by God to lead them out of Egyptian slavery?  Hadn\u2019t their great King David been chosen by God, himself?  They&#8217;re the chosen people even if they don\u2019t act like it.  The prophet shatters their theology, telling them that God has an interest in all peoples, not just Israel.  Even as his gracious hand was seen in the creation of Israel, it could also be seen in the creation of their neighbors: the Philistines and the Arameans.  Granted, Amos goes right on to promise that unique blessings the Lord will pour out on Israel when he makes \u201ceverything right again for my people Israel.\u201d  Still, the point has already been made that God loves all his creation and that he&#8217;s working in the lives of all people, accomplishing his purposes.  Of course, I want to enthusiastically endorse this message with a big \u201cAmen.\u201d  Otherwise, I\u2019m an outsider, blundering along, blindly feeling my way through life.  God\u2019s work among the nations may be different than what he was doing with Israel, but it\u2019s just as real.  I find it both interesting and encouraging that even in the book of Amos which is quite focused on Israel and Judah that I find this missionary element.
