The problem isn&#8217;t in how they worship, it&#8217;s in how they live the rest of the time.  God says they&#8217;ve just been &#8220;playing games&#8221; and &#8220;ignoring everything&#8221; he says.  They respond by trying to jazz up their worship by bringing in some exotic incense from Sheba.  Can&#8217;t you hear it: &#8220;the worship service seems a bit down lately, let&#8217;s get some of that really good incense from Sheba, that&#8217;ll give us just the spark we need.&#8221;   However, it doesn&#8217;t work.  God isn&#8217;t impressed and their worship services remain as empty as before.  Listen, I&#8217;m all for fixing things up and I&#8217;m a firm believer in presenting a well ordered, prepared worship service.  Adding our version of \u201cincense from Sheba\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.  However, that stuff only makes a difference if the worshipers are backing up their wonderfully choreographed and innovative church services with faithful day to day living.  Otherwise, the new &#8220;incense&#8221; won&#8217;t please us or the God we worship.<br \/>\nTake Away: Being a worshipper of the Lord includes a lot more than just going to church.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our incense from Sheba Jeremiah 6: Your religious rituals mean nothing to me.
