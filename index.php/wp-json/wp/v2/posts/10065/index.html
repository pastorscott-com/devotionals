The Apostle answers a few of their questions and then defers the remainder until he can meet with them in person. When he deals with the chain of authority from God to man to woman he bases this approach on how other churches see it. He also warns them that chain of authority or not, that there\u2019s not a lot of value in \u201cwho\u2019s first\u201d debates anyway. Church dinners are a concern. He\u2019s not really against them meeting together for a meal but he\u2019s greatly concerned that the \u201chaves\u201d are meeting early so they can eat their fill before the \u201chave-nots\u201d arrive. On the topic of communion, Paul brings out the big guns. What he\u2019s about to say doesn\u2019t come from the practices of the other churches as is the case with the chain of authority. Rather, this comes from the Lord, himself. They must always receive the communion meal in reverence and in remembrance. They\u2019re to be very careful that they \u201cnever let familiarity breed contempt\u201d and they\u2019re to handle the meal as a spiritual activity and not as a way to satisfy their hunger. For a person to do otherwise is to bring judgment on his or her life. As I read this passage I can\u2019t help but compare the \u201cthat\u2019s how all the churches do it\u201d to \u201cthese instructions come from the Master himself.\u201d \u201cHow the churches do it\u201d ought to carry weight with us. God\u2019s people have carefully thought out how to best operate as Christians, applying their faith to current concerns. As a part of the Church I\u2019m to take those traditions and practices quite seriously. However, beyond that is the \u201cinstructions of the Master.\u201d Sometimes God wants things done in a particular way. I might sometimes (rarely) look at \u201chow the churches do it\u201d and think times have changed and a different approach might better reflect my faith in today\u2019s culture. At the same time, I\u2019d better be very careful here. Some things come from the Master himself. I have absolutely no authority to make adjustments in those areas.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: On occasion, with the passage of decades, the traditions of the Church might change, but the Church never has the authority to ignore the specific commands of the Master.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Q&amp;A session 1Corinthians 11: I received my instructions from the Master himself and passed them on to you.
