His undisciplined behavior with women and specifically his inability recognize Delilah for the traitor she is has cost him everything. His pride, strength, freedom, and eyesight are gone. The phrase &#8220;his hair began to grow again&#8221; is powerfully symbolic of what\u2019s happening in Samson&#8217;s heart. As he does the work of an animal, grinding out grain, somehow, through his darkness, he begins to see God. However, a word of clarification is needed here. This isn&#8217;t a Samson story; rather, it\u2019s a God story. We aren&#8217;t to focus on Samson&#8217;s strength or his stupidity, but on the marvelous grace of God. Samson had been raised up to be a deliverer of his people and even in his miserable state the Lord&#8217;s still willing to work in his life to that end. &#8220;His hair began to grow again&#8221; is a hopeful word in a terrible situation. This is a picture of our God of Second Chances at work. Samson&#8217;s end is not the conclusion to the glorious story as it could have been. In the exercise of his free will Samson sabotages his own life. However, even when everything&#8217;s messed up we find God at work salvaging even this destroyed life. That&#8217;s the kind of God I serve.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances, full of grace and mercy, offering us undeserved restoration.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The God of Second Chances Judges 16: But his hair, though cut off, began to grow again.
