Here, we start at the end of his life.  The writer seems to be in a hurry to get to King David and I think I know why.  This book is being written to remind the people of Israel where they came from and who they are.  The desire is to reignite their connection to one another and to God.  Saul could have been the first and greatest king of Israel, but he failed, dying not in glory, but in disobedience.  Later on, we\u2019ll work through the failures that led to the exile, but here in the early going the idea is to inspire and ignite enthusiasm.  Sad to say, Saul\u2019s story might be good for warning people of pending failure but it won\u2019t do much to unite and give a sense of pride.  There\u2019s a time to focus on such things.  After all, spiritual failure is a real possibility.  For now, though, the writer just wants to set up the story of David and give his readers something to cheer about.  Know what?  That\u2019s okay with me too!<br \/>\nTake Away: While we know all about spiritual failure it\u2019s good to be reminded of the very real possibility of spiritual success too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Starting at the end 1 Chronicles 10: Saul died in disobedience.
