Uprisings are put down; there\u2019s an ugly story of the Gibeonites revenge against Saul&#8217;s descendants, and a series of one-paragraph accounts of significant battles with the enemies of Israel. Of course, for those involved these are all very big deals (especially for those executed by the Gibeonites!). For us, though, they\u2019re just historical events. David&#8217;s army is still fiercely loyal to him but his power as a warrior diminishes with age. When he\u2019s nearly killed in battle his men forbid him from leading the fight as he\u2019s done for decades. He\u2019s simply not up to hand to hand combat anymore and is more valuable as God&#8217;s chosen leader than he is as a soldier. In other words, this is a transitional time for David. His advancing age doesn\u2019t hinder his ability to lead, but it does compromise his ability to fight. For each of us, as it is for David, life has times of transition. Generally, we don&#8217;t like that very well, but circumstances have a way of dragging us forward, even if we\u2019re kicking and screaming all the way. God isn&#8217;t finished with us, but the role we play changes. Let\u2019s be aware of what\u2019s happening and cooperative with God as we move through the various chapters of our lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: As one period of life ends another begins with a new set of challenges and opportunities<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Passages 2 Samuel 21: No more fighting on the frontlines for you!
