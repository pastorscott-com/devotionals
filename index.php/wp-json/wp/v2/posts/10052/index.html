Some folks have decided that they have a corner on God\u2019s truth. Other folks have done the same and their \u201ctruth\u201d is different than that of the others. They\u2019ve had duels with their Bibles and some of the discussion has brought more heat that light. There have been a few church parking lot conversations and not a few phone calls. Any day now things are coming to head and the result won\u2019t be pretty. The outsiders don\u2019t even understand the fight but they do see this as another example of the failure of Christianity. \u201cThey can\u2019t even get along with one another, much less save the world.\u201d The thing is that this isn\u2019t Christian behavior. The Bible says that one Christian isn\u2019t supposed to demand that other Christians do things their way. Paul\u2019s main example is dietary concerns and he also tosses into the mix the concept of keeping a day as holy. The Apostle practices what he preaches here. If I think something is important I\u2019m to pursue it in my life, doing it as unto the Lord. Meanwhile, I\u2019m to leave you alone about it. We have bigger fish to fry (or maybe tofu in this case). The Lord invited us to follow him and to join him in extending the hope of salvation to others. How can we do that if we\u2019re fussing about the finer points of the Law? Beyond that, this isn\u2019t optional in the Christian life. Paul says we\u2019re not \u201cpermitted to insist on our own way in these matters.\u201d He adds, \u201cYour task is to single-mindedly serve Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If God\u2019s people live in obedience to these words of Scripture the entire church world will be turned upside down.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making the main thing the main thing Romans 14: None of us are permitted to insist on our own way in these matters.
