That would be a sin against God! I&#8217;m staying right here at my post&#8230;.<br \/>\nSamuel&#8217;s an old man but he has plenty of life left. If these people had trusted God with the future Samuel would have kept them on the right track for years to come. Then, at the right time, the Lord would have raised up another national and spiritual leader to guide them even as he gave them Samuel. It isn&#8217;t going to be that way though. They insisted on having a king and God has given them one. Still, there\u2019s evidence of God&#8217;s grace here. The Lord won\u2019t forsake them. If they and their king cooperate things will be just fine. Now, Samuel adds a personal note. Even as God promises to remain faithful, so does he. Really, Samuel can do nothing else. As God&#8217;s man his actions must reflect God&#8217;s character. It would be unthinkable for him to say, &#8220;I represent God, and God is going to stand by you; but as for me, I\u2019m out of here!&#8221; People who represent God, those who claim to be his people, reflect God in all their lives. Samuel could have gotten his feelings hurt and just &#8220;handed them over to God&#8221; but he doesn&#8217;t do that. As a man of God I must allow my life to reflect his character even when people treat me unfairly or misunderstand me or hurt my feelings. It\u2019s simply a part of being a man of God.<br \/>\nTake Away: The people of God reflect him in all they do and say \u2013 on both good days and bad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reflecting God 1 Samuel 12: And neither will I walk off and leave you.
