His general, Abner, makes Saul&#8217;s son, Ish-Bosheth king over Israel. Meanwhile, David has moved to Hebron in the area of Judah. He\u2019s made king there. Israel\u2019s now divided, with the larger part being ruled by Saul&#8217;s son and the smaller area ruled by David. The result is civil war. David no longer needs to run. He has an army equal to that of Israel. Because of that both sides jealously defend their territory. This is civil war at its ugliest, with relatives battling one another. One major battle takes place at the Pool of Gibeon, where the armies meet face to face. In a deadly game, representatives from each side are pitted against one another in one-on-one fights to the death. As David&#8217;s men win one round after another things escalate to a major battle in which fighters from each side can call one another by name. It is ugly, ugly, ugly. Civil wars are the worst wars in which people who know one another and share common interests and goals fight it out, leaving corpses scattered across the battlefield. There\u2019s nothing more tragic than war within the family. Church people should do everything possible to avoid such wars. The problem is that, as happened at the Pool of Gibeon, such wars start with much smaller barbed &#8220;games&#8221; of saying two edged things to one another or giving or taking offense easily. Oh, how we need the grace of God in our relationships with one another.<br \/>\nTake Away: We can more skillfully hurt those closest to us \u2013 so dealing with these precious ones must be especially flavored with grace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>War games aren\u2019t fun 2 Samuel 3: The war between the house of Saul and the house of David dragged on and on.
