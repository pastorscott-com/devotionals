It seems they\u2019ve done all they can do.  However, they\u2019ve totally missed it.  In all their plans they\u2019ve failed to look to the One who has plans of his own for their city.  Isaiah says that God&#8217;s plan includes their repenting of the sins that brought them to all this in the first place.  Instead, they make their own plans and then throw parties, saying, &#8220;Eat and drink now, for tomorrow we may die.&#8221;   This refusal to acknowledge God and, instead, to rely on themselves is going to cost them everything.  The truth is that we ought to identify with all this, possibly as a nation, but definitely as individuals.  God has plans for you and me and his good will to us has been abundantly demonstrated.  With that in mind my life should be focused on him.  Instead, I tend to do things my own way and then, once in a while (especially when things get difficult) I pause to look to God and ask him to help me do what I\u2019ve decided to do.  That isn&#8217;t the way it\u2019s supposed to be.  It isn&#8217;t that I\u2019m to never have a thought of my own, but it is that I\u2019m to live in partnership with the Lord.  Instead, I tend to &#8220;look and look&#8221; but never look &#8220;to him who gave&#8221; me life in the first place; to him &#8220;who has long had plans&#8221; for my life.  When I fail to look to him it&#8217;s a recipe for disaster.<br \/>\nTake Away: Failing to look to the Lord is a recipe for disaster.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making God\u2019s plan my plan Isaiah 22: You looked and looked, but you never looked to him who gave you this city&#8230;who has long had plans for this city.
