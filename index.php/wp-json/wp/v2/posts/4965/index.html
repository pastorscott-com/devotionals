When they hear of the expedition to Jerusalem they bravely sign up to return to the land of their birth. These people have stories to tell of what life was like in Jerusalem before it was destroyed. When they stand before the pile of stones that was the center piece of the city their memories are almost more than they can bear. More than anyone else these senior adults realize all that\u2019s been lost. Now, as the foundation for the new Temple is being laid and the dedication celebration is taking place, the younger people shout in excitement. These \u201cremember-ers,\u201d however, begin to weep aloud. Their weeping is a mixture of sadness and joy. They join with the younger people in rejoicing over prospect of the place of worship being rebuilt but they\u2019re saddened as they remember just how much has been lost. The rebuilding of the Temple means a return to God. For the younger people, this is something new and thrilling. It takes the senior adults, those who\u2019ve been &#8220;around the block&#8221; a few times, to fully appreciate the power of this event. As I hear these white-haired people weeping aloud I\u2019m reminded of the depth some precious \u201csenior saints\u201d provide to my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Senior Christians offer a depth of perspective that won\u2019t come from any other source.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The remember-ers Ezra 3: People couldn&#8217;t distinguish the shouting from the weeping.
