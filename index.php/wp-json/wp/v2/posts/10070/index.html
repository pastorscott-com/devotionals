On one hand, they appear to be a template for what a Christian church isn\u2019t supposed to be. There are failures upon failures there and in this letter the Apostle is like a fireman trying to extinguish several blazes. On the other hand, he has a warm, fatherly, relationship with them. He\u2019s not angrily ready to toss them aside. Instead, he sees them as worth redeeming. Beyond all that, I have the distinct feeling that my impression of this congregation is rather one sided. There\u2019s plenty wrong there, but a lot of it is likely associated with their being enthusiastic about living for the Lord and, at the same time, are coming out of a clueless, immoral culture. The result is enthusiastic ignorance. Maybe that\u2019s better than being knowledgably bored! Paul concludes his letter by restating his love for them. They may be an ignorant and frustrating crowd, but Paul claims them as his own. It\u2019s a pretty good reminder of how things are supposed to be in the family of God. We may have a few who are sometimes a bit off the grid, (of course that doesn\u2019t include you and me!) but we love them just the same. After all, we\u2019re together in this family of God.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: As the old saying goes, \u201cSometimes I wonder about everyone but me and thee\u2026and sometimes I wonder about thee.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m glad I\u2019m part of the family of God 1Corinthians 16: And I love you all in the Messiah, Jesus.
