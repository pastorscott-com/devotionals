The celebration is impressive and genuine. David, the newly recognized King of Israel, leads the way as all Jerusalem celebrates. I can&#8217;t help but think of the drum major of the great Tiger band from Grambling State University. No marching in military precision here! David, warrior and king, lays all that aside in unrestrained exuberance before God. However, it isn&#8217;t David&#8217;s abandoned drum major like dance in leading the Ark that impresses me today so much as his open heart before God. As I study David&#8217;s story I find that his life isn\u2019t mistake-free. In fact, he messes up a lot, and sometimes in major league ways. It\u2019s his good heart that commands my attention. This man loves God with every fiber of his being. His drum major routine with the Chest of God opens for me a window to his very heart.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord loves it when we worship him with abandon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unrestrained joy 2 Samuel 6: David&#8230;danced with great abandon before the Lord.
