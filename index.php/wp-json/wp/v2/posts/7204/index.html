In light of that vision any claims to righteousness are blown away.  His brokenness brings him to the place of honest confession which is just what the Lord\u2019s waiting for.  Immediately, the Lord takes action to cleanse him of his sin.  Since this is a vision, there\u2019s a lot of symbolism here.  We have an altar of sacrifice with fire, which speaks to us of surrender and purification.  There\u2019s Isaiah\u2019s direct reference to his \u201cunclean lips\u201d which refer to, not just a tendency to say the wrong thing, but his whole life, which he sees as speaking in ways that reflect a deep level of spiritual need.  The thrilling thing is how the Lord responds to Isaiah\u2019s cry of repentance.  A heavenly being touches his lips with the burning coal from the altar declaring the wonderful truth that his sin is \u201cwiped out\u201d and his guilt is gone.  Listen, I don\u2019t have to pull some surprising insight out of this passage.  In fact, it\u2019s surprising enough just as it is.  When I realize the purity of God and see my own deep failure\u2026when I confess it, throwing myself on the mercy God\u2026when I do that, I place myself in the only place where the Lord can help me.  I can\u2019t forgive my own sin and I can\u2019t purify my own life, but when I \u201crepent and turn\u201d he immediately does for me what I can never do for myself.  There\u2019s no better word from the Lord than \u201cgone your guilt, your sins wiped out.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: As I confess my need the Lord does for me what I can never do for myself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s response to my need Isaiah 6: Gone your guilt, your sins wiped out.
