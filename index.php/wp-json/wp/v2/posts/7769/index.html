Honor me.<br \/>\nI was out doing some errands this week and dropped by the church for a minute. No one was there but me but when I went into the sanctuary, almost without thinking, I removed my hat. At that point I smiled to myself that no one would know whether or not I removed my hat in reverence and I wondered if the Lord even cared. I\u2019ve seen church guys working in the building who went in and out of the sanctuary without a thought about it and, frankly, I\u2019m okay with that. Still, there\u2019s something about being in that place where we worship the Lord that makes it special to me and I want my actions there, even on a Monday when no one else is around, to reflect that reality. Through his prophet the Lord calls for the people of that day to pick up the task of rebuilding the Temple. Practically speaking, they can worship the Lord anywhere. As Jesus put it in John 4:24: \u201cGod is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\u201d Still, there\u2019s value in setting aside sacred space. Haggai tells them that God feels honored when people make a special effort to provide a place of worship. While I understand that the Temple has a unique role in the life of the people of Israel I still think there\u2019s a connection between it and the place where I worship. We should seriously think about the fact that the Lord didn\u2019t say, through Haggai, \u201cYou can worship me anywhere, just do it with all your heart\u201d but, instead said, \u201cRebuild the Temple; do it just for me. Honor me.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s value in setting aside sacred space.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sacred Space Haggai 1: Do it just for me. Honor me.
