This isn\u2019t Star Trek and he didn\u2019t go \u201cboldly\u201d but Jonah finds himself \u201cwhere no man has gone before.\u201d In this predicament Jonah wonders if prayers from the inside of a fish at the bottom of the sea can possibly reach heaven.  Since he has no other choice he begins to cry out to the God he fled.  Years earlier the suffering Job heard the Lord promise that he visited the \u201csprings of the sea.\u201d  Now Jonah becomes the first human being to put that statement to a literal test.  Later he reports, \u201cMy prayer got through&#8230;.\u201d  Now, I\u2019ve never been deep under water in the belly of a fish.  I tried scuba once but I stayed pretty close to the surface so I\u2019ll just have to take Jonah\u2019s testimony at face value.  However, I\u2019ve been in some situations in which I felt distant from God and I wondered if my prayers could ever get through \u2013 but they did!  In this passage I find hope for every person who thinks they\u2019re so far from God and have messed up so many times that they\u2019re gonners.  Today I see that the Lord hears prayers, even from the depths of the sea.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s hope for every person who thinks they\u2019re so far from the Lord that there\u2019s no hope for them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About as low as you can go Jonah 2: My prayer got through to you.
