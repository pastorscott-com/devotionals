Clearly, the Almighty is interested in more people than just those of Israel.  He&#8217;s been paying close attention to the downward spiral of the region and is about to shake everything up.  Clearly, this isn&#8217;t as drastic as the Flood was in Noah&#8217;s day, but it is a remaking of this entire region.  Jeremiah writes it all out as poetry: awful, frightening words put to verse.  It&#8217;s in the message to the Ammonites that I find the phrase, &#8220;I, God, say so, and it will be so.&#8221;  To me, that pretty much sums up these painful-to-read chapters.  This is an aspect of the Lord that makes me uncomfortable.  Frankly, I don&#8217;t like these chapters.  Then again, I don&#8217;t have to.  Sovereign God, the Giver of Life, surely has the authority to be the Taker of Life.  What he does along these lines is on his side of the equation, not mine.  He doesn&#8217;t have to explain himself to me and I don&#8217;t have to like how it all works out.  I find some consolation in the fact that the very words I read today are warnings to these nations, given before the fact.  In theory, at least, their turning to God might have resulted in a display of his mercy.  Instead, these people live evil lives and are addicted to cruelty.  In bringing Judgment on this region the Almighty is acting unilaterally and he doesn&#8217;t need my approval and support.  Today as I remember who God is and who I am I find myself learning a lesson in humility.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord acts according to his own Sovereignty we can simply accept it \u2013 after all he doesn\u2019t need our understanding, permission, or approval.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lesson in humility Jeremiah 49: I, God, say so, and it will be so.
