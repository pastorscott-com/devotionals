What examples are good ones for me to study and then apply to my life?  Paul says the place to start is by looking upward.  As a child of God I study his behavior, doing all I can to make true the proverb, \u201clike Father like son.\u201d  If I want to see those attributes \u201cwith skin on them\u201d I look to Jesus.  Whatever I see in Jesus, I attempt to copy into my life.  And what do I see?  I see extravagant love.  Out of love my Lord gives of himself without reservation.  He doesn\u2019t use God for his own purposes.  Rather, he reflects the loving compassion of the Father in all he does.  The Apostle says that I get chances to live like that.  Opportunities to love selflessly come my way and I need to make the most of those opportunities.  Some folks miss that boat and rather than filling their lives with Christ-like love they let other things dominate their lives.  I understand the problem.  Everyday a thousand voices cry out to me.  Like carnival front men they invite me to try their game.  If I\u2019m not careful, I wander off into their diversion.  Today, I\u2019m reminded that love is the thing.  When all is said and done in my life, the big deal will be love.  Have I loved God with all my heart and soul and mind?  Have I loved my neighbor as myself?  This passage reminds me to \u201cmake the most out of every chance I get.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Love is the thing.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paying attention to the big deal of life Ephesians 5: Observe how Christ loved us.
