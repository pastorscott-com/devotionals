Now I see them being described as \u201csecurity guards.\u201d  I guess that\u2019s what gatekeepers are supposed to do: they provide security, seeing to it that all who enter are there for legitimate purposes.  King David is such a multifaceted person.  He\u2019s a singer and songwriter and harp player, a skilled leader, and he\u2019s a warrior who\u2019s won countless battles.  In this case, I see him drawing from his \u201cwarrior\u201d skills in organizing the Levites.  In spite of the peaceful conditions of the day David prepares for possible trouble.  Now, it might be that the sons of Korah are basically ushers who tell people where the corral is for their soon to be sacrificed lamb but I\u2019m guessing that David also wants them there \u201cjust in case.\u201d  I wonder to what extent, if any, this applies to the Church today.  There have been some horror stories in the news, and, obviously, a church full of people is probably viewed as an easy target by some very bad people.  I\u2019m not seeing this as some kind of mandate, but there is, at least to some extent, a precedent here for a church to have at least some unofficial security.<br \/>\nTake Away: Leadership involves, in addition to having a vision and sense of direction, the ability to think through the practical concerns of the organization.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security guards 1 Chronicles 26: The teams of security guards were from the family of Korah.
