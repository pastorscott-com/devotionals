Others have come their way with hard luck stories and claims of greater enlightenment. They\u2019ve asked for and received offerings from the church there. Now, when Paul writes to them in authoritative tones they tend to discount his ministry to them because they didn\u2019t pay for it. Paul\u2019s about to join the traveling preachers in stating his credentials and sharing his hard luck stories, and both are much more impressive than those of the traveling preachers they\u2019re listening to. The Apostle wonders if he cheated them by letting churches elsewhere support his ministry during his time in Corinth. He thought he was doing them a favor, making it clear that he wasn\u2019t in it for the money, but now he wonders if they\u2019d be more inclined to listen to him had they supported him during his time there. Paul makes it clear that he\u2019s not sorry he ministered to them as he did, so I don\u2019t want to make more of this than is there. Still, it\u2019s a point worth consideration. Generally speaking, people value that which costs them something. If it\u2019s just handed to them, they think it\u2019s worth what they paid for it. In this passage, I see that, on one hand, sometimes it\u2019s best to just give our ministry away, making it as easy as possible for people to receive it. On the other hand, though, it\u2019s fair and right that people support those who minister to them and, in fact, their doing so increases the value of that ministry in their eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We tend to value that which costs us something.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You get what you pay for 2Corinthians 11: My needs were always supplied by the Christians from Macedonia province.
