One response to personal disaster should be a reexamination of our lives.  If things aren\u2019t as they should be this is a good time to ask the Lord to forgive us and ask him to help us get our act together.<br \/>\nTake Away: One response to personal disaster should be a reexamination of our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praying in catastrophes Joel 2: And here\u2019s why: God is kind of merciful.
