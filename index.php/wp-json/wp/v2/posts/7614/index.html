He talks about birds and cattle and snakes, of shepherds and their unending battle to protect their flock against the predators.  Some things, he says, are as plain as the nose on your face and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to recognize them.  If one hears a lion growling in pleasure, for instance, you know that it&#8217;s killed its prey.  This stuff, he explains, is just how it is.  Then Amos makes his application.  When people rebel against God the Lord will act to remedy the situation.  It doesn\u2019t take a degree in theology to know that God won\u2019t put up with sin forever.  As a prophet of God, Amos is responsible for speaking God\u2019s message.  His sermons aren\u2019t made up fiction or the rants of someone who&#8217;s stuck in the past.  When you hear a lion roaring nearby the sane reaction is to be frightened.  When God\u2019s prophet says God is tired of his people living in rebellion it\u2019s time to straighten up.  If the roar of a lion gets our attention, how much more should words of warning from the spokesmen of God.<br \/>\nTake Away: It doesn\u2019t take a degree in theology to understand that when people rebel against God the Lord will act to remedy the situation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The lion\u2019s roar Amos 3: The lion has roared \u2013 who isn\u2019t frightened?
