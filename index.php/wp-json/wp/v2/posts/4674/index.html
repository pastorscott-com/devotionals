Solomon&#8217;s response is to execute some people. This isn\u2019t pleasant devotional reading but there\u2019s at least an insight into why David sets this agenda for his son. When Joab\u2019s executed we\u2019re reminded that he\u2019s killed some innocent people. Then we read, &#8220;Responsibility for their murders is forever fixed on Joab and his descendants; but for David and his descendants, his family and kingdom, the final verdict is God&#8217;s peace.&#8221; We see that these executions aren\u2019t for revenge but rather are for justice. David believes that if the crimes committed by these people are left without response that he and his descendants will be responsible in part for what happened. The concept here can only be carried so far and it\u2019s important to remember that Solomon isn\u2019t acting here as a vigilante. He\u2019s acting in the capacity of king, head of the government. But let&#8217;s step away from the specific of executions and also lay aside the role of the government here. When I do that I\u2019m still reminded that if I stand by while some wrong is done, declaring, &#8220;It\u2019s none of my business&#8221; I become a part of that wrong. That\u2019s true not only for government but for individual citizens as well.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes doing nothing makes us as guilty in the eyes of the Lord as if we have done something.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seeking a righteous response 1Kings 2: The final verdict is God&#8217;s peace.
