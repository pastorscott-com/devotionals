Here\u2019s a man driven by arrogance and drunk with power.  The Lord strips all that away from him and sends him out into the wilderness for seven years.  That sounds like a long time, but its short compared to the 40 years it takes the Israelites to learn a similar lesson.  We don&#8217;t know what\u2019s happening inside of Nebuchadnezzar during those long years of insanity, but somehow God is dealing with him and the end result is filled with redemption.  In fact, one of the strongest examples of this is the fact that Nebuchadnezzar is allowed to write his own testimony, found here.  His words are filled with humble praise and thanksgiving to God.  This is a case of strong discipline yielding desirable results.  Nebuchadnezzar is made into a new man by the grace of God.  Know what?  That&#8217;s just the kind of stuff God does.  The focus here shouldn&#8217;t be on seven years of mental illness.  The central issue here is that God takes messed up lives and makes them new.  The &#8220;grass diet&#8221; was just the method.  The made-new life is the result.  Nebuchadnezzar isn&#8217;t complaining about the diet, but he certainly thanks the Lord for what he did for him.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord takes messed up lives and makes them new.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grass diet Daniel 4: He knows how to turn a proud person into a humble man or woman.
