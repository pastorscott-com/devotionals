Honestly, when I first read of Daniel&#8217;s opening his window toward Jerusalem for prayer three times a day I had the impression he had some sort of reverent ritual of prayer.  I have nothing against praying the prayers of other people or of repeating prayers that are meaningful to us and I had the feeling that Daniel prayed like that.  Now, as I arrive in chapter nine I have the actual text of one of Daniel&#8217;s prayers.  It&#8217;s anything but a ritual of prayer!  Here&#8217;s a man pouring out his heart to God.  Daniel has had a disturbing vision, he&#8217;s been reading Jeremiah&#8217;s troubling prophecies, and, as he considers these things his heart is broken.  I note that Daniel doesn&#8217;t pray about \u201ctheir\u201d sins when thinking of the sins of his people.  He sees a nation drowning in sin and, without joining them in their rebellion, jumps right into the pool with them.  In other words, Daniel doesn&#8217;t piously hover above all the sinners calling them to repent.  Rather, he becomes one of them and then begins to plead with God for forgiveness and restoration.  His humbleness in identifying with lost people is a powerful picture of intercessory prayer.  Also, there&#8217;s zero self-justification here.  Daniel doesn&#8217;t try to explain to the Lord that there&#8217;s a righteous remnant left or that he, himself, has never wavered.  Instead, he grieves &#8220;our sins,&#8221; confesses that God is right in judging those sins, and pleads for mercy and forgiveness.  I need this lesson because I live in a sinful nation that seems intent on seeing how angry it can make God.   At the same time, there are millions who have been swept along by this flow, not so much in rebellion against God as in confusion and ignorance.  Like Daniel of old, I pray, &#8220;Lord save us.  We are sinners living apart from you, lost and without hope.  Have mercy on us, not because we deserve it but because you are the God of mercy.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Jesus taught his followers to pray for forgiveness for \u201cour trespasses\u201d \u2013 not \u201ctheir trespasses.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intercessory prayers Daniel 9: All we have to show for our lives is guilt and shame.
