Then the imagery changes and Judah is seen as a fruitful vine, not as majestic as before, but now under the dominion of Babylon and transplanted there.  Ezekiel says that in rebelling against Babylon this &#8220;fruitful vine&#8221; will also be uprooted and then allowed to die out.  It seems that this is just another gloom and doom message.  That&#8217;s just what it is until we reach the final paragraph of the chapter.  The illustration appears to leave us with a destroyed Judah, with no leadership, rejected by God.  Then Ezekiel adds a new dimension to his illustration.  Once again we find ourselves looking at a mighty cedar.  This time, God, personally, takes a cutting from the very crown of the tree.  The great tree will be destroyed, but out of that cutting a new monarchy, a new King, will rise to lead Judah.  This new cedar will be the greatest of all.  Ezekiel has given us a parable of the Messiah.  This Chosen One will rise out of the line of David, but will rule as none of the old line ever ruled.  He&#8217;ll be King of kings, and Lord of lords.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord always keeps his promises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking upward, seeing hope Ezekiel 17: I, God, made the great tree small and the small tree great.
