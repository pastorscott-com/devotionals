It isn&#8217;t that big a step.  They were already toying with such things before, although before fleeing Jerusalem they had kept a dash of Jehovah worship mixed in with their religious practices.  Now that Jerusalem&#8217;s destroyed and they&#8217;ve deserted that place they think they&#8217;re free from God Almighty too.  They embrace all things Egyptian.  The popular thing to do is &#8220;walk like an Egyptian.&#8221;  Meanwhile, God&#8217;s anger toward them increases.  Back in Judea when everyone else was either being killed off or carried off to live the rest of their lives in Babylonian exile these people had been spared.  &#8220;Blest&#8221; is probably too strong a word, but it&#8217;s clear that they were treated less harshly than were their fellow Israelites.  Their response: run the opposite direction, away from their homeland and away from their God.  So, again, God&#8217;s fed up with them.  If they like Egypt so well, they can have it along with the judgment that&#8217;s coming to that land.  God says to them, &#8220;It&#8217;s all over; I have nothing good left for you.&#8221;   I&#8217;m not a gloom and doom preacher but passages like this concern me.  We Christians are so quick to embrace the current cultural fads.  We&#8217;re entertained by the same things, buy into the same materialistic values, and, in general, fit into the broken culture of our day.  The Lord tells those who fled to Egypt that, if they like Egypt so well, he\u2019ll treat them as he&#8217;s going to treat the Egyptians.  Maybe we Christians ought to think twice before we get too carried away with &#8220;walking like an Egyptian.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: We\u2019re in the world but we\u2019re not to be of the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Walk like an Egyptian Jeremiah 44: The good is gone.
