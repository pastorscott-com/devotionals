The book is about Solomon&#8217;s quest for meaning, how he tries many of the things people still try today, and how he concludes that none of them live up to their promise.  In The Message, Peterson picks up on the &#8220;quest&#8221; of Solomon and calls him, &#8220;the Quester&#8221; rather than &#8220;the Preacher.&#8221;  In other words, the emphasis is on the search for meaning, happiness, and satisfaction rather than on the proclamation of the result of that search.  Solomon wants more than power, wealth, fame, peace, and success.  Having tried them all, he\u2019s convinced that they\u2019re not all they\u2019re cracked up to be.  Actually, Ecclesiastes doesn&#8217;t try very hard to give us &#8220;the answer&#8221; but it does a good job of asking &#8220;the question&#8221; concerning the search for answers to the big questions of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Like the writer of Ecclesiastes people today still search for meaning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Searching for answers to the big questions of life Ecclesiastes 1: These are the words of the Quester, David&#8217;s son and king in Jerusalem.
