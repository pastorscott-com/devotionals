It\u2019s intriguing to see this call to holiness from a holy God surrounded by all these mundane concerns.  Clearly, the Lord wants his holiness to be found in the lives of his people and not just when the High Priest enters into the Holy of Holies or when Moses ascends the shaking Mount Sinai.   As I see obvious cultural concerns along with universal moral issues all being thrown into the mix together and then am told that the underlying concern in all of it is holiness I realize just how wrong it is to confine holiness to a small area of the Tabernacle.  God is calling his people to apply their relationship with him to not only how they conduct worship in the new Tent of Meeting but also how they live their everyday lives.  That\u2019s a message I need today.  After all, part time holiness isn\u2019t much holiness at all.<br \/>\nTake Away: Living a holy life has as much to do with what happens outside the church as it does what happens inside it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Holiness everywhere, all the time Leviticus 19: Be holy because I, God, your God, am holy.
