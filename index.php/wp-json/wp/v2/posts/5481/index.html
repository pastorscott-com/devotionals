That theme is very much present in this passage, but it really isn&#8217;t the heart of its message.  The core of this portion of Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy is the &#8220;all people&#8221; statement.  God&#8217;s salvation, we\u2019re told, isn\u2019t just for the Jewish &#8220;insiders&#8221; but for the Gentile &#8220;outsiders&#8221; as well.  Those with physical limitations whose worship experience is limited by the laws of Deuteronomy are not to be treated as second class worshipers.  In fact, God promises that those who fall in the &#8220;outside&#8221; category yet are faithful to the Lord will be given an honored place, even more honored than that of the insiders.  Everyone is invited to come to the &#8220;house of prayer for all people.&#8221;  My response to this passage today is on two levels.  First, I thank God for it because I&#8217;m one of the outsiders who have been granted access to the Lord.  I wasn&#8217;t born to the right family but I\u2019ve been adopted in.  Second, I want to conduct my life with a strong realization that God welcomes people who aren\u2019t like me.  As one who\u2019s been graciously granted access, I gladly join the &#8220;welcoming committee&#8221; that invites other outsiders in.  Also, while I won&#8217;t take time to develop it here, the literal meaning of this passage reminds me that there are those who need special accommodation to fully participate in the activities at the house of worship.  I want the church I attend to be as assessable as possible for those who have special needs and as welcoming as possible to people from all walks of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord welcomes me but he also welcomes people who aren\u2019t like me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All are welcome here Isaiah 56: My house of worship will be known as a house of prayer for all people.
