They\u2019re doing a good thing, bringing the Chest of God back from obscurity to its rightful place of honor in Jerusalem.  Everyone agrees that it\u2019s \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d  For transport they go so far as to build a brand new cart and David and others lead the way in a joyful procession.  It\u2019s at the threshing floor in Kidon that disaster strikes.  The oxen pulling the cart stumble and Uzziah, who is, it seems, somehow involved in the mechanical part of the move reaches out and touches the Ark to steady it.  That\u2019s when the shocking thing happens.  God strikes Uzziah dead for showing a lack of reverence for this holy object.  If you expect me to explain all this away I\u2019m afraid I must disappoint you.  Even David who&#8217;s right there is frightened by what he\u2019s just seen.  He decides to put the Ark in the building there, unwilling to bring it to Jerusalem.  It may be that Uzziah didn\u2019t really need to steady the Ark and only used the incident as an excuse to reach out and touch it.  After all, everyone knew that the Ark was to be carried with poles so that the Levites who were entrusted with the task wouldn\u2019t ever actually touch it.   However, that\u2019s just speculation.  Ultimately I\u2019m left with my belief that God\u2019s character is pure love and that he never acts in a way contrary to his character.  This situation, like a million others, is beyond me.  It\u2019s another of those \u201cI\u2019ll just trust God anyway\u201d situations we find in both the Bible and in our own lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: Happily, our salvation isn\u2019t based on knowledge, but is, rather, based on faith.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ll just trust God anyway. 1 Chronicles 13: God erupted in anger against Uzziah and killed him because he grabbed the Chest.
