He also sees, maybe not with total clarity, life after death for the Messiah.  From our common point of view following death there\u2019s deterioration.  Even as Isaiah describes the terrible destruction of the Suffering Servant, he finds himself talking about abundant life.  Our understanding of what happened at, and after, Calvary isn\u2019t superior to Isaiah&#8217;s but we do have a clearer knowledge of those events.  Jesus goes to the cross and there suffers and dies for the sins of the human race.  His lifeless body is then placed in a tomb.  Then, early on Sunday morning, the after-death process is abruptly halted.  Rather than deterioration, life, new life, springs forth.  Resurrection!  That&#8217;s reason enough for Isaiah to conclude his mourning over the death of the Messiah with a surprising &#8220;life oriented&#8221; twist.  However, there\u2019s even more.  As the suffering and death of Jesus is for us, so is his resurrection.  We have hope of spiritual and physical life beyond this world because of what happens at that tomb.  At one point Jesus says that he came that we might have abundant life.  That promise is made sure the first Easter morning.  Isaiah&#8217;s vision of &#8220;life, life, and more life&#8221; not only tells the story of the Suffering Servant, it\u2019s our story too.<br \/>\nTake Away: As the suffering and death of Jesus is for us, so is his resurrection.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Life after death \u2013 what a concept!
