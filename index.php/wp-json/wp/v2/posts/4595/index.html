David has already spared his life once, at the cave in En Gedi, but when he receives word that David is at Hakilah Hill he gathers 3000 of his best soldiers and goes out to get him. David&#8217;s sentries spot this large unit as they enter the area and he and his men track their every movement. Saul sets up camp as night falls. Once more David decides on dramatic action to prove to Saul that he\u2019s not a threat to his kingdom. Accompanied by brave Abishai, David slips into the camp and takes the spear from beside where Saul is sleeping. Abishai sees this as the opportunity to pin Saul to the ground with his own spear, but David refuses, saying he won&#8217;t lay a finger on God&#8217;s anointed. David believes that God put Saul in office and, even though Saul is a shadow of the man he was then, God will deal with removing him from office. So what do I learn from this? As a pastor, I\u2019m tempted to talk about pastor\/congregation relationships. However, I think it goes beyond that. To a great extent all of God&#8217;s people are his &#8220;anointed.&#8221; God has chosen each of us to be his very own. I&#8217;d better be careful that my words don&#8217;t wound one of God&#8217;s people. He considers each of us to be his own and anoints us with his presence. I don&#8217;t have to always like what you say or do, but I&#8217;d better treat you with the respect due to God&#8217;s servants. Otherwise, I risk following Abishai&#8217;s route rather than David&#8217;s.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is quite interested in how his people treat one another.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s people need to go easy on one another 1 Samuel 26: God forbid that I should lay a finger on God&#8217;s anointed.
