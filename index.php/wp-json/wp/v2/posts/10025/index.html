Some of the Jewish Christians want the Gentiles who convert to adopt Jewish rites, specifically circumcision.  Peter, Barnabas, and Paul argue that it\u2019s all about Jesus and that faith in him as Savior and Lord is all that\u2019s necessary to be saved.  Will Christianity be a branch of Judaism or will it be a religion of its own?  It\u2019s a tough decision for this group, made up of Jewish men who follow a Jewish Savior.  However, the answer&#8217;s really easy.  As Peter points out, the Holy Spirit has already ruled on the issue, earlier, as he preached at the house of Cornelius.  Barnabas and Paul affirm this.  They\u2019ve been \u201cout there\u201d and seen what happens when Gentiles simply believe in Jesus.  Now James weighs in, this time with Scripture that declares God\u2019s intention to include the Gentiles who will, indeed, have a place at the table of his grace.  If these new followers of Jesus will just avoid a few things that the Jewish followers of Jesus find especially objectionable there will be, not two flavors of Christianity, but one.  Obviously, this new religion will be diverse but it will, never-the-less be united.  <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christianity is about the Christ and any focus elsewhere is mistaken.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No yarmulke or \u201cminor surgery\u201d necessary Acts 15: So why are you now trying to out-god God, loading these new believers down with rules.
