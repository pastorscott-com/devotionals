However, being a fisherman and not a swordsman, Peter takes a swing at the wrong person (a mere servant) and tries to take his head off (but misses).  He ends up cutting off his ear instead.  Luke tells us that Jesus performs a miracle, reattaching the ear.  He also tells Peter that in his Kingdom sword play isn\u2019t allowed.  Now, as Jesus is being tried Peter warms himself by the fire in the courtyard but people keep suggesting that he might be one of the disciples of Jesus.  Peter denies it, but one man is quite sure.  In fact, he\u2019s a relative of poor Malchus who, just a short time earlier, was on the receiving end of Peter\u2019s sword.  Obviously, it\u2019s in Peter\u2019s best interest for this man to not know he\u2019s the \u201cear-cutter-off-er\u201d!  I don\u2019t know whether or not this man knows the rest of the story, what Jesus did for Malchus and what he told Peter, but I can\u2019t help but think his opinion of Jesus and his followers isn\u2019t all that high right now.  \u201cOh yeah, I know about followers of Jesus, they pretend to be all spiritual and holy but I had one try to cut off my head one time.\u201d  Sad to say there are a lot of Christian sword swingers out there.  They go about saying and doing mean things, hurting feelings, and acting downright hateful; all in the \u201cName of Jesus.\u201d  They think they\u2019re doing something good for the Lord but all they\u2019re doing is alienating people and slandering the Name of the One they think they\u2019re serving.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Sword play isn\u2019t allowed in the Kingdom of God.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With friends like us&#8230;.
