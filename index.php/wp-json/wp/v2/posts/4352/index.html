The Shema of Deuteronomy 6 is not all there is to God&#8217;s intentions for us, but it\u2019s the center point for all else, the foundation upon which all else is laid.  God is one.  He exists.  All that we can hope for and all that we can ever expect to know starts here: God is God.  And, God desires our love.  He wants us to love him without reservation; with absolute abandon.  This isn&#8217;t all that we should know about God&#8217;s desire for us, but it starts here.
