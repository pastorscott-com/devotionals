When they\u2019re mentioned by the writers of the Bible those writers assume everyone knows all about them, so there\u2019s no description or explanation of how they were used.  Some think they were a sort of dice used to ascertain the will of the Lord \u2013 kind of like casting lots.  Others believe that the Lord used them by causing some combination of precious stones on them to glow, indicating \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d \u2013 a sort of red light\/green light approach.  Apparently, the High Priest was not only the keeper of the Urim and the Thummim but also the only one who was authorized to use them in seeking the will of the Lord.  I think I lean toward the red light\/green light understanding of the Urim and the Thummim.  After all, even as these are being used there\u2019s a Pillar of Fire and Cloud overhead and manna appearing every morning.  Having glowing stones of some sort to give direction is certainly in keeping with all the other miracles they\u2019re experiencing daily.  I can\u2019t help but think that having a Urim and Thummim would sure be handy today.  Once, when I was barely out of my teens I tried using my Bible that way.  I had a decision to make and tried praying about it, and then flipping my Bible open to read the first verse I saw.  I kind of got an answer, but looking back, I think I saw what I really wanted to see in the first place.  These days I better understand that God calls me to a life of faith and trust.  He\u2019s a communicating God and when he has something to say to me I won\u2019t need glowing stones or a random verse from the Bible to know what he\u2019s saying.  Still, I admit that if I had a Urim and Thummim in my pocket that I\u2019d be tempted to use them once in a while!<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is well capable of communicating his will to me if I\u2019ll patiently listen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Urim and Thummim Exodus 28: Place the Urim and Thummim in the Breastpiece of Judgment.
