He hears a voice, issuing to him a command and a word of permission. He\u2019s been invited into Heaven and is immediately filled with a sense of deep worship as he finds himself gazing on the very Throne of God. Everything\u2019s overwhelming and, as he tells us about it, human language fails him. There\u2019s worship going on and we\u2019re left with the feeling that this is business as usual at the Throne. Heavenly beings sing \u201cHoly, holy, holy\u201d and those with crowns of righteousness cast those crowns at the feet of the One seated on the Throne. What&#8217;s business as usual in Heaven is all too rare on this side of that door. I\u2019ve had some wonderful moments of blessing, some too precious for me to write about. They haven\u2019t come nearly often enough but when they have come I\u2019ve tasted just enough to long for more. Still, I&#8217;ve received an invitation to that place. I don\u2019t know when it is that I\u2019ll hear \u201cAscend and enter\u201d but I do know that that command and word of permission will come someday. I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t like the process of getting there, but once I do, it&#8217;ll be worth it all.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We\u2019ve received that wonderful invitation to \u201cascend and enter\u201d so let\u2019s live as invited people, preparing for that day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What an invitation!
