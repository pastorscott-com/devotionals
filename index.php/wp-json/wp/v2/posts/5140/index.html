He lives larger than life.  I have the idea he\u2019s more passionate over his breakfast each morning than I am over the biggest events in my life.  When David&#8217;s up, he\u2019s really up, filled with joy and praises and song.  That&#8217;s not me.  The top of his roller coaster ride is far above mine!  I confess that I sometimes envy those &#8220;Davids&#8221; in my life, so full of life and passion.  On the other hand, when David is down, he\u2019s really down!  He doesn&#8217;t stop at being somewhat discouraged, instead, he feels absolutely abandoned.  He isn&#8217;t just frustrated; instead, he\u2019s filled with despair.  The bottom of the roller coaster ride for people with the &#8220;David personality&#8221; is far below mine and when I see them down there in so much pain I confess that I feel a little superior, or at least a bit glad that I&#8217;m not like that.  The neat thing is that God made both of us and he sees something of himself in each of us.  I have a long way to go, but in my personality, and in others who are wired like me, there\u2019s just a hint of God as the &#8220;solid Rock,&#8221; our &#8220;firm foundation.&#8221;  Then, when I am around a &#8220;David&#8221; I see something of God&#8217;s passion and zest.  Of course in God we see it all without the flaws that are associated with the human versions, then in Jesus we see humanity perfected, just as God intended in the first place.  It occurs to me that one purpose of the Psalms is to let people like me hitch a ride with people like David.  I won&#8217;t make it to the top with him and I won&#8217;t have to ride with him to the bottom, but I might be stretched just a little.  That\u2019s a good thing.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s something of the Lord in every positive personality type.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Highs and lows and in-betweens Psalm 30: I can&#8217;t keep quiet about you.
