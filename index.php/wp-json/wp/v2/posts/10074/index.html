He describes himself as unimpressive, the kind of person you meet at a party but don\u2019t remember the next day. Maybe he\u2019s just being honestly humble here. However, he wants his readers to know that it\u2019s his message that matters and not the power (or lack thereof) of his personal presence. He imagines himself to be a plain clay jar that holds a treasure of unimaginable value. To look at the outside no one would ever guess what\u2019s on the inside. Here he is: a plain sort of fellow sharing an extraordinary gift with all who will receive it. This is such an important concept and one that resonates with me. It\u2019s the message that matters. Other servants have other gifts, some quite impressive and often well used of the Lord. The bottom line, though, is that we\u2019re all mere messengers, \u201cerrand runners.\u201d On the surface, we\u2019re ordinary or less. What we have to give is a gift beyond imagination. For my part it\u2019s good to be reminded of my place in this grand scheme. I\u2019m honored to be a \u201cplain clay jar\u201d used in the service of the Master. As I realize that the message is bigger than this messenger I\u2019m reminded of my responsibility to never let my life get in the way of my message.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Message of God is more important than the messenger.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m just an old lump of clay 2Corinthians 4: All we are is messengers, errand runners from Jesus for you.
