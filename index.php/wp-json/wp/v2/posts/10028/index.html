In the beginning he focuses his ministry on the Jews living there and has some success.  However, others become more and more entrenched in their rejection of his message.  At some point he decides there are more productive ways to minister in the Name of Jesus and ends up next door to the Jews\u2019 meeting place at the home of Titius Justus.  There Paul sets up shop for at least 18 months, preaching about Jesus and establishing a church in Corinth.  After working primarily with the Jews Paul realizes that continuing to do so is not a profitable use of his time and energy.  In his case, there\u2019s a better place right next door.  How often do we get so locked into a certain way and place that we continue to try to ride a horse that\u2019s long dead?  As the truism goes: \u201cwhen the horse is dead it\u2019s time to dismount.\u201d  Some churches are still trying to do things the way they were done in 1950 and they wonder why what worked so well then no longer packs any punch today.  They blame others who aren\u2019t on board for not being spiritual enough or yield to living in a defeated shadow of yesterday.  Paul decides that continuing to do what he has been doing is no longer effective so he changes his approach, opening the way for a long and productive ministry.  His message remains the same, but his method is upgraded.  The mission is permanent but the method is fluid.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We must not confuse the message with some transitory method.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Method upgrade Acts 18: Paul had finally had it with them and gave it up as a bad job.
