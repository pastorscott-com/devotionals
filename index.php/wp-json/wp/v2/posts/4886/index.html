As the people of Israel grasp this lofty concept they begin to joyfully and generously give. \u201cSacred space\u201d has always been important to the people of God. It\u00a0isn&#8217;t\u00a0that God can\u2019t meet us out in the common places of life because he certainly does. It remains though, that setting aside times and places for the express purpose of encountering the Lord is not only biblical, but is spiritually beneficial too. Note that this passage\u00a0doesn&#8217;t\u00a0describe the creation of personal, private spiritual hide-a-ways. This passage reminds us of the value of having a place set aside for the purpose of cooperate meetings with the Almighty. As the people of God, we have much to gain by creating sacred space in which we wait upon the Lord together.<br \/>\nTake Away: We aren\u2019t intended to be \u201cLone Ranger\u201d Christians.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More than a meeting house 1 Chronicles 29: This is not just a place for people to meet each other, but a house for God to meet us.
