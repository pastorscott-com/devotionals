The country is filled with shrines and altars, some dating back for centuries. Near Jerusalem stands an iron furnace that is used for child sacrifices. Clearly, the spiritual condition of Judah was pitiful, as the commandments of God have been ignored for generations. Josiah&#8217;s discovery of the Law of God shocks him to action. What he does isn\u2019t some cosmetic religious reform. This is all out transformation. Josiah uses the Book as an instruction manual on how to live and worship. He follows it to a letter. For instance, the Book of the Covenant describes observing the Passover, something that hasn&#8217;t been done for centuries. Josiah reads the Book and follows the directions, reestablishing this observance. The result is that God is pleased with him, giving him an &#8220;A+.&#8221; Because of his faithfulness an entire generation is changed. Today, Josiah inspires us to take God seriously and to swim against the tide of popular culture. Josiah&#8217;s story gives us hope of transforming our society.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord is given a chance, wonderful, life-changing things happen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The boy-king gets an A+ 2Kings 23: The world would never again see a king like Josiah.
