However, I can&#8217;t help but think that the &#8220;friendship&#8221; model only works at one level.  This Friend is the King of Kings.  He&#8217;s holy and eternal.

If I call him &#8220;Friend&#8221; it&#8217;s only because he allows me to.  The priests of Ezekiel&#8217;s day treat the holy as common.
