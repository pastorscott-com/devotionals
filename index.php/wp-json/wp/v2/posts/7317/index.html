Softly and tenderly I wait for him.<br \/>\nIn this passage the tribe of Ephraim represents the people of Israel.  Jeremiah imagines Israel humbly coming to the Lord, asking if it&#8217;s too late and wondering if the Lord can ever embrace her again.  God&#8217;s answer is immediate and compassionate.  The Lord says that that\u2019s all he\u2019s wanted to hear all along and that the strong medicine was administered not because he had stopped loving Israel but preciously because of his love.  This great God of love has longed for his people to return to him and with great tenderness he waits to receive them back to himself.  I can\u2019t help but respond to this passage in a personal way.  I\u2019m moved by God&#8217;s compassion on, not only ancient Israel, but on the lost people of my day.  When I\u2019m in rebellion against God he longs for my return; reaching out to me, crying out in love.  Today, I stand in awe of the mercy, grace, and compassion of God for a lost human race.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is love.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Lord, reaching out Jeremiah 31: Everything in me cries out for him.
