However, Bildad does take us down a bit different track. He argues that only God is truly perfect, and next to him, everything else comes up short.  Even the stars of the sky are lacking in God&#8217;s eyes.  Since that\u2019s true (according to Bildad) God is justified in bringing calamity on anybody, including Job.  After all, we\u2019re all less than insects when compared to God.  That&#8217;s his argument, but it isn&#8217;t a very good one.  Job replies that he maintains his integrity even in the midst of what he sees as an unjust trial.  His argument isn\u2019t that he\u2019s perfect.  Rather, it\u2019s that he\u2019s just.  Job understands something that many modern Christians fail to grasp.  There\u2019s a difference between imperfection and unrighteousness.  God looks, not on our performance, but on our intent.  My humanity guarantees that I\u2019ll have a sub-par performance.  However, by God&#8217;s grace, I can live for God and maintain my integrity before him even in the worst of times.  Samuel learned this truth before anointing David King of Israel: &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.&#8221; (1 Samuel 16:7)  Job may be struggling with several theological concepts, but he has this one down pat.<br \/>\nTake Away: By the grace of the Lord it is, indeed, possible to have a pure heart in his sight.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The difference between imperfection and unrighteousness Job 25: Even the stars aren&#8217;t perfect in God&#8217;s eyes.
