It\u2019s interesting that the prophet&#8217;s focus turns away from &#8220;right now&#8221; to looking to a much brighter day.  In the future the people of Israel and Judah will return to this land.  At that time the Lord will do &#8220;marvelous and wondrous things&#8221; for them (that is, their descendants).  God has made some specific promises to this nation and even though, right now, it seems that everything\u2019s falling apart, God has never lost sight of those promises.  It\u2019ll all start with the return of the people of Israel to this land.  Every promise the Lord has given them will be fulfilled.  While it\u2019s true that things are going to get worse before they get better, it is just as true that things will get better; in fact, better than they can imagine.  Right now it seems that God&#8217;s anger and dismissal of them will be their epitaph, but it isn&#8217;t so.  Jeremiah says that in the end, when everything\u2019s being summed up that the conclusion to it all will be that God has had mercy on them.  Getting from where they are to that wonderful conclusion isn&#8217;t going to be easy, but in the end, when all\u2019s said and done, it\u2019ll be clear that everything that happened was an act of divine mercy.  It&#8217;s hard to see the big picture when I\u2019m in the middle of things that aren&#8217;t going to suit me.  At times like that I have to simply trust the character of God: that he\u2019s a good and merciful God who loves me.  The last word concerning God&#8217;s dealings with me will be: &#8220;mercy.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for his unfathomable mercy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s last word Jeremiah 33: The last word is, I will have mercy on them.
