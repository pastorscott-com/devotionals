In Job&#8217;s story we find him in a state of misery, lamenting all that has been lost.  Lamentations takes us into similar unwelcome territory.  The destruction of Jerusalem isn\u2019t a tidy event.  There&#8217;s a long siege that results in starvation and a descent into barbarism of the worst sort.  It&#8217;s the mildest of statements to say that things get ugly.  Inhumanity and misery rule.  Now, Jeremiah, still reeling from it all creates poetry in an effort to describe the remaining sense of loss and grief.  While it&#8217;s true that their destruction is the result of their own sin the misery of it all is real.  In Lamentations the weeping prophet takes us on a walk through the rubble of his beloved Jerusalem.  He replays for us the scenes of murder and rape and loss.  I confess that I&#8217;m not looking forward to spending these few days with Jeremiah.  Two things come to mind as I begin this journey.  First: loss is a part of the human condition.  Even as Job faced it, so does Jeremiah; and so do we.  Second: sometimes we&#8217;re wise to allow ourselves to embrace this unwelcome aspect of life.  We tend to hurry past the bad times; to smile through our tears; to cheer up believing things will get better.  It really doesn&#8217;t work that way.  The route to healing may begin with our taking time to grieve &#8212; to lament &#8212; all that&#8217;s been lost.  Like it or not, that&#8217;s the path we follow when we walk with the weeping prophet in the book of Lamentations.<br \/>\nTake Away: The route to healing may begin with our taking time to grieve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working through grief and loss Lamentations 1: Judah has gone into exile.
