Numbers of people and cattle and cities; who lives where and how many days between various worship events.  It isn&#8217;t exactly riveting reading.  In fact, it would have been easy to miss the pure gold at the end of chapter 35.  The issue here is how the people are to deal with murder.  Due to the fact that the laws God gives the Israelites are foundational to our own legal system it seems to be pretty common stuff.  Actually though, it\u2019s groundbreaking material, reshaping human society.  God insists on justice, and adds that if society takes murder lightly the whole land will be polluted.  Then he adds, &#8220;don&#8217;t desecrate the land where you live &#8212; after all, I live here too.&#8221;  In spite of the dreary subject, this is a wonderful phrase of hope.  Their Creator, the Sovereign of the Universe, God Almighty says his address is on their street.  These days, because of the Gift of the Holy Spirit, things are even more personal.  God lives, not just &#8220;in the land&#8221; but &#8220;in my heart.&#8221;  If God&#8217;s presence in the land emphasized the importance of purity there, how much more does his presence in my life call for purity of heart?<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s a wonderful blessing to have the Lord call our lives \u201chome\u201d \u2013 at the same time it carries with it a real sense of responsibility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cCome into my heart, Lord Jesus\u201d Numbers 35: Don&#8217;t desecrate the land in which you live.
