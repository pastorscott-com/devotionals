Even as he cries out to God in his brokenness, God speaks to the hearts of those who\u2019ve been in charge as things among the Jews in Jerusalem unraveled. They humbly come to Ezra confessing their sins but also confessing their faith that &#8220;all is not lost&#8221; and that there&#8217;s &#8220;still hope for Israel.&#8221; Now, all they ask is for Ezra to take charge and help them find their way back to God. That&#8217;s just what Ezra does, and the short book that bears his name is concluded with the route to restoration he lays out. Ezra&#8217;s broken heart over the sins of the people, including his willingness to embrace their sin as his own, is an incomplete story without this. For me to convince people of their sin and to even join them in confessing that sin as &#8220;ours&#8221; is a wonderful start. Still, most people need help in moving from repentance to restoration. To assume this role is a great privilege and responsibility.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s such a privilege to help people find their way to the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From repentance to restoration Ezra 10: Now get up, Ezra.
