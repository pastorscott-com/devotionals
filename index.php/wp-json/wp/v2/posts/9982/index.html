On some days he\u2019s healed so many people that they couldn\u2019t even keep track of them all.  He\u2019s fed thousands and walked on water.  He then explains it all as the result of faith.  They\u2019re convinced so they ask Jesus to give them more faith.  His response is that with faith there\u2019s no such thing as more or less.  You either have it or you don\u2019t.  A \u201clittle bit\u201d of faith is as powerful as a \u201clot\u201d of faith.  At least that\u2019s what I hear Jesus saying in this passage.  At other times, though, Jesus talks about people having \u201cgreat\u201d faith and he sometimes chides the disciples for having \u201clittle\u201d faith.  Here\u2019s what I think Jesus is saying: when I have faith I believe God can do anything.  When I have great faith I apply that belief in some extraordinary way.  It\u2019s not my faith that\u2019s large or small.  Rather, it\u2019s my application of what I already believe that can be \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201csmall.\u201d  Like the disciples, I don\u2019t really need to believe in God more.  I already believe that he is Almighty and acting in the world.  However, also like the disciples, I do need to trust him with more of my life, even the areas that are so big and menacing that I tend to be overwhelmed by them.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Lord, I believe.  Help me with my unbelief.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Big faith, little faith Luke 17: There is no \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless\u201d in faith.
