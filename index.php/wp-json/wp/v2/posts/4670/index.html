The first failed miserably and the second became Israel&#8217;s greatest king. Now we come to the stories of all the rest. All fall somewhere between Saul and David. These \u201cking stories\u201d start with &#8220;King David grew old.&#8221; It\u2019s interesting to be reminded that even great people grow old. Our days are numbered and, while it\u2019s a blessing to live to old age, it isn&#8217;t really much fun to get there! Physically David&#8217;s wasting away. His circulation isn\u2019t good and he\u2019s cold all the time. His aids come up with an interesting solution for keeping him warm at night. They recruit the young and beautiful Abishag who serves as a sort of &#8220;electric blanket&#8221; for &#8220;poor&#8221; old David. It brings a smile to our faces now, but even the Bible writer notes that David&#8217;s advanced years assure that their relationship is purely platonic. The more serious issue for Israel is that there&#8217;s jostling among his surviving sons as to who will to take the throne. Throughout David&#8217;s 40 years on the throne of Judah and then Israel Absalom&#8217;s effort to take the throne has been the only serious threat to Israel&#8217;s stability. Now, King David grows old and national unity is threatened once again. David has just one more thing to do. He has to name his successor. Once that&#8217;s done the burden of leadership will be lifted from his frail shoulders. I can&#8217;t feel sorry for David. He\u2019s lived a robust life. If anyone ever &#8220;grabs the gusto&#8221; it\u2019s David. Now though, even though he\u2019s bigger than life, it\u2019s life (or maybe better, death) that&#8217;s winning. So it is for all of us. There\u2019s only one alternative to getting old and it isn&#8217;t a very good choice. With that in mind, I want to live as large as I can; to serve God right now with all my strength. Then, when my turn comes I want to be able to look back on a life lived all out for God.<br \/>\nTake Away: We only have one opportunity to live our lives enthusiastically for the Lord, let\u2019s not miss this opportunity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time flies when you\u2019re having fun 1Kings 1: King David grew old.
