Adam and Eve either doubt the wisdom or the honesty of God who commands them to avoid the fruit of a certain tree because to eat it, he says, will result in death. As I read from Jeremiah I hear the Lord insisting that his orders are for our own good. &#8220;If you do what I say your lives will go well&#8221; he says. If I\u2019m not careful, I translate this to mean, &#8220;Do it the way I say and I&#8217;ll go easy on you, do it your own way and I&#8217;ll go hard on you.&#8221; However, that isn&#8217;t his message. The idea is that God not only has my best interests in mind, but he knows what will help me and what will harm me. If I say to my 5 year old, &#8220;honey, don&#8217;t play with electric outlets&#8221; I&#8217;m not just making a random rule. Rather, I&#8217;m speaking out of both good will and superior knowledge. The Lord tells me that if I obey him, he&#8217;ll be my God and I&#8217;ll be his son. He says that as I abide in that relationship I&#8217;ll have a better life than I would have otherwise. Really, this isn&#8217;t mystical or theoretical stuff; it&#8217;s just the way it is.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord\u2019s way is the best way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Telling it the way it is Jeremiah 7: Do what I command so that your lives will go well.
