Then, off in the distance a light is shining.  At first, it\u2019s barely visible, but in time bright enough to create excitement in all who\u2019ve longed for this darkness to end.  Then, coming out of that light is a runner, silhouetted by the glow behind him.  He advances toward them and the crowd gathers, wondering what\u2019s going on.  They then hear him shouting something and the broken people strain to hear his words.  He\u2019s shouting, &#8220;Good news, good news.&#8221;  With the light brightening behind him the runner races into their still-darkened camp.  The people are quiet as everyone gathers around the runner who shouts out &#8220;Good news&#8221; one last time.  He then catches his breath and cries out at the top of his lungs: &#8220;God reigns!&#8221;   At first the people are stunned, and quietly speak these words among themselves, &#8220;God reigns.  God reigns.&#8221;  Then, without really thinking about it, they begin saying those words in unison: &#8220;God reigns. God reigns.&#8221;  The chat becomes a shout as hands and voices are raised, &#8220;GOD REIGNS, GOD REIGNS.&#8221;  Their sins have separated them from God.  It seems that all that\u2019s left is darkness and hopeless death.  Now, a new day is dawning, a day of salvation.  God is once again stepping into their lives. &#8220;God reigns.&#8221;  Thank God for messengers of Good News.
