Their nation has been defeated and many have been exiled far from home.  They blame it all on their parents and consider themselves to be victims of the failure of others.  Ezekiel says that isn&#8217;t so.  While it&#8217;s true that their ancestors failed God, the current generation has plenty of failure of its own.  Ezekiel wants them to understand that when a wicked person turns from his or her wicked ways that God is gracious and rich in forgiveness.  God, he tells them, doesn&#8217;t hold a grudge.  On the other hand, if a righteous person abandons that righteousness he or she stands guilty before God.  Past righteousness doesn&#8217;t make a person immune from current failure and judgment.  The bottom line is that the Lord will &#8220;judge each of you according to the way you live.&#8221;  The spiritual principle here is that it&#8217;s our current relationship with God that really matters.  Ezekiel&#8217;s advice is still good today.  He says since it&#8217;s &#8220;right now&#8221; that counts, those who are living apart from God and blaming their parents (or someone else) for it need to &#8220;turn around&#8230;make a clean break&#8221; and &#8220;live!&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: It&#8217;s our current relationship with the Lord that really matters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accepting fault, doing something about it Ezekiel 18: The soul that sins is the soul that dies.
