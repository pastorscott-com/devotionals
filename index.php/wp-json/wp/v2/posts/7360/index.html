Egypt also invades and conquers the nation.  Jehoiakim is made king of Judah by the Egyptian conquerors.  It\u2019s during his years in power that the Lord tells Jeremiah to write down a recap of all the prophecies that have been made concerning Israel and Judah.  Jeremiah obeys, dictating his messages to Baruch, who serves as his secretary.  The prophet sends Baruch down to the Temple to read it all to the people and the message creates uproar.  Before long, Baruch, scroll in hand, finds himself before king Jehoiakim.   The king, though, isn&#8217;t impressed with Jeremiah&#8217;s message.  As Baruch reads, the king takes a small knife and trims away each column as it\u2019s heard.  He then, in an act of rejection, throws what has been cut off into the fire.  When Baruch returns to Jeremiah and tells him what\u2019s happened, Jeremiah starts all over again, dictating another message from God, this one more elaborate than the first.  Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot here, but I find myself thinking about how God brought about the Sacred Writings that make up our Bibles.  In this case, God doesn&#8217;t dictate a message to Jeremiah to dictate to Baruch.  Instead, the Lord just tells Jeremiah to write down a summary of all the prophecies he\u2019s given concerning Israel and Judah.  Jeremiah goes to work, dictating to Baruch who faithfully writes down what he hears.  The real kicker to me is that when this process is done a second time, we&#8217;re told that Jeremiah adds some stuff to it.  In other words, there isn&#8217;t just one way for this scroll to be written.  The Lord wants Jeremiah to tell the story, and I have no doubt that the Lord helps Jeremiah remember many specifics.  However, for the second round, Jeremiah wants to add some stuff.  It isn&#8217;t that he\u2019s making things up; he just remembers more and decides to include it.  We have here a pretty neat example of how the Scriptures were given to us.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t dictate word for word (that is, unless it says he did).  Instead, he says, &#8220;write about this event or tell the message you received from me.&#8221;  From there, the writer\u2019s free to frame things in his own words and even from his own perspective.  Because of that we hear from the Scriptures not only the &#8220;big message&#8221; of God&#8217;s intentions, but also the &#8220;little message&#8221; of how the writer views the world.  If you think about it, that&#8217;s a pretty good example of how God works in this world: partnering with humanity and even accepting some of our limitations.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord wants us to partner with him in what he\u2019s doing in the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How inspiration works Jeremiah 36: There were also generous additions, but the same kind of thing.
