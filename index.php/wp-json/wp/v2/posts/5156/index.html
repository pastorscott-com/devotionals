We know him as a child and then journey with him through his rich, eventful life to old age.  This psalm is written in his later years and the long shadows of this evening portion of his life are evident in his words.  The early part of the song is retrospective.  David remembers his childhood and God&#8217;s blessings.  Then, skipping his full life, David asks the Lord to continue blessing him in his senior years.  There are no more wars for him to fight, no more giants to be slain, but David is now in a fight that he will not win.  Is God only interested in young, energy-filled people?  Will David, as his vitality slips away, be put on the shelf and forgotten by not only man, but by God too?  David knows that\u2019s not going to happen.  Even as an old and grey headed man he enjoys the faithfulness of God.  These days he isn&#8217;t out taking on the enemies of God in battle, but he has plenty to say.  People need to be reminded of the story of God&#8217;s goodness and they need to know what it means to really worship.  Gray headed or not, David sets out to lift the Lord, showing the way to praise and worship.<br \/>\nTake Away: The way to conclude life is to continue setting an example of trusting and praising the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking back, remaining faithful Psalm 71: I&#8217;ll keep at it until I&#8217;m old and gray.
