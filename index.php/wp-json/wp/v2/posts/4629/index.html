He and David stood together in the dark days years earlier. At that time they made promises to one another and David hasn\u2019t forgotten those promises. When David learns that Jonathan has a surviving son he seeks him out. Mephibosheth is lame and has had no contact with David, yet David treats him with respect and kindness. Mephibosheth, obviously, has done nothing to earn anything from David. In fact, as the grandson of Saul, he might still have a claim on the throne in the eyes of some people. Most kings of that era would make it their first order of business to wipe out all his predecessor&#8217;s heirs to the throne. David, though, does the very opposite. He returns all Saul&#8217;s wealth to Mephibosheth and then gives him an honored place in his own household. David&#8217;s action here reminds me of the unmerited favor the King has shown to me. Like Mephibosheth, I\u2019ve done nothing to make myself worthy of this great kindness. And, as David reached out to Mephibosheth because of Jonathan, so has the Lord reached out to me because of Jesus.<br \/>\nTake Away: All the people of the Lord are recipients of the unmerited favor of God \u2013 unworthy, but made welcome in his household.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unmerited favor 2 Samuel 9: Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, taking all his meals at the king&#8217;s table.
