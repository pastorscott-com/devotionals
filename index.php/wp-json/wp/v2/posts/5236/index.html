He married hundreds of women and then tells us that having a good wife promises a man a good life and the blessings of God.  Seriously, I know that his marriages were nothing like the marriages of my culture.  For him, as Head of State, marriage was part of sealing a treaty between one nation and another.  Since Solomon&#8217;s influence spread throughout the known world there were lots of treaties to be sealed!  With that in mind I&#8217;ll cut him some slack on this one.   Another thing that brings a smile is that he tells the other side of the story in the next chapter.  If finding a good spouse equals having a good life, finding a nagging one, he says, is like having a leaky faucet in the house: drip, drip, drip.  Apparently, some of his &#8220;treaty wives&#8221; weren&#8217;t all that much of a blessing!  When I put these two proverbs together I see what a powerful influence husbands and wives have on one another.  We can become a constant irritation, making the other miserable or we can be a source of joy and blessing.  It\u2019s reasonable that every husband and wife take stock once in a while to be sure that their spouse views them as evidence of the favor of God on his or her life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Be a blessing and not a constant \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d to the person you love the most!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Love and marriage Proverbs 18: Find a good spouse, you find a good life &#8212; and even more: the favor of God!
