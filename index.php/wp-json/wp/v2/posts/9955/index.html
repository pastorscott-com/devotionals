They\u2019ve just returned from preaching\/healing expeditions.  The possessed have been set free, the sick have been healed, and the Good News has been proclaimed.  Upon their return, Jesus calls a time out for a retreat of sorts.  They head for a wilderness spot where he can debrief them and they can be refreshed.  In this case it doesn\u2019t work out.  People find out where they\u2019re going and there\u2019s a big, needy, crowd waiting for them when they arrive.  Jesus\u2019 heart is stirred by their need and he abandons the retreat idea in favor of ministering to these poor, lost sheep.  I know, first hand, of the need to unplug and get away from the day to day responsibilities of life.  In my case, as a pastor, I guess I get just a very small taste of what it is that has zapped the energy of the disciples in this incident.  However, I think the concern is similar for just about everyone who goes out to face the world each day.  There\u2019s a time for unplugging from the stuff of everyday and letting body, soul, and spirit be refreshed.  Still, in light of the entirety of this passage, I\u2019m also reminded that when I love people and have a chance to minister to their need I\u2019m to respond as best I\u2019m able.  In this situation, the opportunity to minister to people trumps the desire of Jesus that the disciples get some rest.  Life is a balancing act.  Here we see Jesus changing his priorities because he\u2019s presented with a great need and opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If we\u2019re to properly represent Jesus in this world we have to remain flexible and responsive to opportunities that come our way.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The best laid plans&#8230; Mark 6: Let\u2019s take a break and get a little rest.
