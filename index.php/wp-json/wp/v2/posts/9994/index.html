And here I am, standing right before you.<\/p>\n<p>It all starts when Jesus heals a lame man with the order to pick up his bed roll and walk.  The wonderful miracle is lost on the religious leaders because it takes place on the Sabbath.  Never mind the miracle, they insist, what\u2019s this about telling people to carry things on the Sabbath?  Pitiful, isn\u2019t it.  When these leaders angrily challenge Jesus he does nothing to calm them down.  Rather, he identifies himself with his Heavenly Father and claims his support and direction in all he does.  How in the world do they think they can win an argument with the man who just worked a miracle?  Jesus moves on to point out that they, Bible scholars that they are, know all about what the Scriptures say about the Messiah.  He tells them it\u2019s time to get their heads out of their Bibles and look in the eye the one testified about by those very Scriptures.  Silly religious leaders!  They\u2019ve given their lives to knowing God\u2019s Word and have now missed the Living Word of God standing right in front of them.  How could they ever think that Bible study is better than fellowship with the Lord who is right there with them?  I\u2019m glad we Christians today know better.  We\u2019d rather spend five minutes in the literal presence of the Lord than an hour of debating some obscure term from the Bible.  Right?   I know, I know, there\u2019s a place for both.  Still, I can\u2019t help but note that Bible studies are generally better attended than prayer meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s better, if one must decide between the two, to know Jesus than to know the Bible.  Happily, we don\u2019t have to decide.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bible studies and prayer meetings John 5: These Scriptures are all about me!
