Don\u2019t push me.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus begins his public ministry, calling disciples and preparing for all that&#8217;s to come.  However, there are also some family concerns.  For one thing, there\u2019s a wedding invitation for him and his new disciples.  Apparently, the groom is a relative of Jesus and not only is Jesus there but so is his mother.  The banquet is a big deal and when the wine starts to run low the groom and his family are in jeopardy of losing face because of it.  It\u2019s their job to provide the refreshments and to run out of wine is unthinkable.  Mary, the mother of Jesus, realizes what\u2019s going on and turns to her son, telling him to take care of it.  Jesus declines to help, saying, \u201cMother, this really isn\u2019t any of our business and I need to keep a low profile right now.\u201d  His response flows off his Jewish mother like water off a duck\u2019s back.  In fact, she doesn\u2019t even respond to her Son.  Instead, she looks to the nearby servants and says, \u201cDo whatever he tells you to do.\u201d  With that, she walks off, returning to the wedding party.  Jesus is, of course Lord: King of kings.  He\u2019s also his mother\u2019s Son.  If there\u2019s a passage that illustrates the humanity of this God-man I think it\u2019s this one.  He\u2019s not ready to start working miracles, but if that\u2019s what his mom wants, well, he\u2019ll do it for her.  Aside from this being the inspiration for a Mother\u2019s Day sermon that\u2019s bound to get rave reviews from all the moms in attendance I don\u2019t know what to do with this observation.  Still, I think it adds a whole new dimension to the story.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s important to remember the humanity of Jesus.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Awe, Mom, not yet!
