He\u2019s come to a decision and now he\u2019s making a firm commitment to abide by that decision.  While Joshua can&#8217;t control what others do Joshua knows what he and his family are going to do: they&#8217;re going to worship God.  I know some might squirm a bit at Joshua&#8217;s including his family in his declaration of intent.  Our Western culture says, &#8220;But Joshua, everyone has to make their own decision &#8212; you can&#8217;t just unilaterally speak for your family.&#8221;  The fact of the matter is that, in his culture, he can do just that.  He\u2019s the leader of his family, and his worship of God isn&#8217;t built around a 21st century reading of John 3:16 anyway.  In fact, while I know this concept can be abused, most families need the man of the house to stand up and say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll worship God.&#8221;  Fathers and husbands need to show some leadership.  Men need to make a commitment and to take action.  I doubt that there are many wives who would be offended if their husband showed some of the manly leadership Joshua shows here.  &#8220;Alright family, I\u2019ve come to a decision:  we\u2019re going to worship God.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: A man\u2019s influence over his family is powerful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Come on guys, be a real man Joshua 24: As for me and my family, we&#8217;ll worship God.
