Each day dignitaries arrive at Jerusalem, each bringing valuable gifts for Solomon. They all want to experience Solomon, a human wonder of the earth. Israel is poised to be a world power for generations to come and every national leader willingly bows to Solomon\u2019s wisdom knowing that the overflow of his prosperity is beneficial to them too. This may be the finest picture in the Bible of God\u2019s temporal blessings. The Lord does, indeed, know how to shower worldly blessings on people and in this case, his intention is to establish Israel forever in this land promised their ancestor Abraham hundreds of years earlier. You and I know this isn\u2019t going to last. Before the children of Israel ever set foot in the Promised Land Moses described for them the \u201cblessing and the curse.\u201d If they obey the result is, well, what we see in this chapter. If they disobey&#8230;sad to say, to see the results we just have to keep reading. I see here God\u2019s desire and intention. He likes blessing us. For the past 2000 years he\u2019s been preparing a place for us that will make Solomon\u2019s Jerusalem look poor in comparison. I understand that not all of God\u2019s blessings are in the health and wealth category, but this chapter of the Bible gives me a glimpse of what he can do, and what he plans to do, if I\u2019ll just cooperate with him.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for his good will, for his grace, and, yes, for his many blessings to us; all undeserved and all humbly appreciated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Golden age 1Kings 10: King Solomon was wiser and richer than all the kings of the earth.
