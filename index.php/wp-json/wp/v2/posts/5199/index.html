Many of its pages contain a history of God and us, telling us not only where we have been but God&#8217;s desire for us in the future.  However, there\u2019s more than even that.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t just want all of us to go to heaven when we die.  Rather, he wants us to live the best lives possible in the here and now.  That&#8217;s what the book of Proverbs is about.  These wise sayings aren&#8217;t written to tell us our history and they aren&#8217;t written to point to way to heaven.  They tell us how to live the wisest way today.
