Our Lord and his disciples have breakfast together and then Jesus and Peter go for a walk.  Peter, who denied the Lord three times, is now asked three times if he loves Jesus.  Each time, as a result of his declaration of love, he\u2019s given responsibility in the Kingdom.  By the third time, though, Peter is burdened with the repeated question.  Jesus responds by explaining to Peter that his love will be his source of strength in difficult days ahead.  He\u2019ll be a prisoner and will be led to places he doesn\u2019t want to go.  In the midst of such a trial, Peter will find strength in his love for the Lord.  Meanwhile, following along is the disciple John.  Everyone knows John is Jesus\u2019 favorite and Peter wants to know what\u2019s coming for him.  Jesus, though, isn\u2019t going there with Peter.  Peter needs to worry about Peter and not about the beloved disciple.  I think we tend to concern ourselves with what God is doing in the lives of others too much.  We forget that we aren\u2019t called to make Christian clones of ourselves but are to \u201cfeed the sheep\u201d and let the Master handle the rest of it.  That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not concerned when I see someone struggling or has even lost their way.  Of course I\u2019m concerned.  Still, I need to be careful to love them and encourage them to follow Jesus and not be too focused on exactly how the Lord might want that to happen in their life.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I love others and want to see them allow the Lord to lead their lives, but my main concern is to keep things clear between myself and the Lord.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Minding my own business John 21: Master, what\u2019s going to happen to him?
