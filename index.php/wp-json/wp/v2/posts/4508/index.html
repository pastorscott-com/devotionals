At our best humans are still pretty pitiful and, in this distant day, most people have no interest in striving for anything close to &#8220;the best&#8221; anyway. Because of that spiritual darkness dominates. Then, in the figurative and literal night God speaks to young Samuel. Even better than that: God speaks and then continues to speak. There\u2019s something wonderful about the phrase, &#8220;God continued to show up at Shiloh.&#8221; It has the feel of springtime in it. After the long, cold winter, the sun is shining and new life is breaking out everywhere. I\u2019ve journeyed through my share of spiritual winters: times when God seemed far away and unreachable. But I\u2019ve also enjoyed spiritual springtime. Frankly, my experience was more like Samuel&#8217;s than I care to admit, because in my case, like his, I didn&#8217;t have much to do with the dawning of the new day in my heart. All I know is that, after the night, God showed up and then continued to show up. By his grace, I will be faithful when spiritual winter comes, but, oh, how I love the spiritual springtime!<br \/>\nTake Away: Spiritual winter comes to just about everyone. How good to be reminded that after the winter season, springtime arrives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spiritual Springtime 1 Samuel 3: God continued to show up at Shiloh.
