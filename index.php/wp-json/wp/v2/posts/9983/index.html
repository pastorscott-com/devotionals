Son of David! Mercy, have mercy on me!<\/p>\n<p>On the outskirts of Jericho a poor blind man spends his day listening for the sound of footsteps that he might beg for some loose change from some passing person.  On this day, though, voices raised in excitement are drawing near and he begins shouting out the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d  Finally, someone responds, \u201cIts Jesus of Nazareth, the miracle worker.  He and his disciples are coming this way.\u201d  The blind man begins shouting at the top of his voice, \u201cJesus! Son of David! Mercy, have mercy on me!\u201d  Several tell him to be quiet and the sound of the crowd nearly drowns him out anyway.  He shouts all the louder, \u201cHave mercy on me!\u201d  Then, a calm, authoritative voice is heard.  Jesus is right there in front of him.  \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he asks.  The blind man answers, \u201cMaster, I want to see again.\u201d  \u201cOkay, do it,\u201d Jesus replies.  Light, color, and movement flood in as sight is restored.  As I read this story, I\u2019m the blind man.  Life is empty, desperate, and hopeless.  Then, Jesus passes by.  In my own words, I shout out \u201cHave mercy on me!\u201d  And he does.  Thank you, Lord, for your light giving mercy in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Its mercy we need and its mercy we receive from the Lord.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Jesus shows mercy Luke 18: Jesus!
