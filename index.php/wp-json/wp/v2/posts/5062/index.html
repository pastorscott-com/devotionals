Obviously this story isn\u2019t about her.  It\u2019s Job&#8217;s faithfulness to God even when he\u2019s getting nothing out of it that drives this story.  Still, I feel sorry for Job&#8217;s wife.  She\u2019s suffered all the same losses he has.  She\u2019s lost everything, including her family.  Now her husband sits before her, quivering in agony.  Her life is ruined.  When she advises Job to give up on God it\u2019s because she already has.  Her response is what Satan predicted Job&#8217;s would be: if the blessings of God are withdrawn human beings will no longer serve him.  Job&#8217;s reply is that this is a foolish approach.  God grants us life and we enjoy the good days that come.  When things turn sour we go on trusting and serving him.  That doesn&#8217;t mean we\u2019re happy about things or that we don&#8217;t change them if we can.  It does mean that we\u2019ve chosen to trust God with both the good and bad that life brings.  Job is angry with God, as we shall see, but he refuses to turn away from Him, even when serving God has resulted in so much pain.<br \/>\nTake Away: Faith is a matter of the will and not a product of circumstances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mrs. Job Job 2: Curse God and be done with it!
