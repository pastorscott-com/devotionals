He\u2019s sinned against God in his affair with Bathsheba and then tried to cover it up by engineering the death of her husband.  His evil plan never has a chance.  All the time God is watching as the whole ugly thing unfolds.  God sends his man, Nathan, to confront David and when he repents he writes this psalm as his prayer of confession.  Its theme is \u201cGod&#8217;s loving grace.\u201d  David pleads for mercy and forgiveness and asks for a changed heart.  There\u2019s no, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try harder&#8221; in his cry to God.  He realizes that his greatest need isn\u2019t better performance but that he be made new from the inside out.  I think the most powerful insight of the psalm is David&#8217;s realization that God isn&#8217;t nearly as interested in performance as he is in motivation.  The Lord isn&#8217;t as interested in our behaving in some proscribed way as he is interested in our hearts.  When the heart is right, performance (within human limitations) will follow.  Otherwise, performance becomes for us, not a source of righteousness, but a source of pride.<br \/>\nTake Away: A changed heart results in changed behavior.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some lessons are learned the hard way Psalm 51: Going through the motions doesn&#8217;t please you.
