He\u2019s told to avoid \u201cinane discussions\u201d because they lead only to fighting. Obviously, Paul\u2019s not talking about having serious discussions in which people have genuine disagreements and are seeking to understand one another\u2019s positions. Still, the principle here is a good one. Believers need to avoid bickering with one another. The longer it goes on the more the two sides get entrenched. Ultimately, there\u2019s a fracture in their relationship in which one side or both gets hurt. Others, sometimes the most innocent people of all, are drawn in and wounded even more seriously by the immature attitudes shown by people who they love, respect, and need. So, how can this mess be avoided? It\u2019s easy, really. \u201cRefuse to get involved.\u201d Some things are worth the trouble and are, in fact, rather important. Most things aren\u2019t. Paul wants Timothy to focus on the good stuff and walk away from the bad stuff. I\u2019ll like my church better if I do that. In fact, I\u2019ll probably like myself better too.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Give your energies to that that really matters, file the other stuff in the \u201cnot-that-big-a-deal\u201d file.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mature enough to walk away 2Timothy 2: Refuse to get involved in inane discussions; they always end up in fights.
