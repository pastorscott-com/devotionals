For years he&#8217;s preached his sermons and acted out various illustrations for them.  His words are seldom encouraging, in fact, they&#8217;re down right condemning.  Beyond that all his approaches to basically the same sermon have become to them like well-worn clothes: nothing to get excited about, but comfortable.  These days, it isn&#8217;t unusual for folks to show up at Ezekiel&#8217;s house on a summer evening just to see what Ezekiel has up his sleeve today.  They aren&#8217;t interested in responding to his message but they do find his rants somewhat entertaining.  As a Sunday preacher I have to say that this passage is chilling to me.  The folks at my church have also heard my sermons for a long time now.  Sometimes I fear that they&#8217;re so used to me that, as it was in Ezekiel&#8217;s day, &#8220;they love to hear you talk, but nothing comes out of it.&#8221;  It&#8217;s interesting how small things become big things as I think about stuff like this.  For instance, a couple of weeks ago I suggested folks take a particular course of action.  Yesterday I was handed something someone had done as a direct result of that sermon.  I can&#8217;t tell you how encouraging that is to me.  It&#8217;s also humbling.  I&#8217;m flattered that anyone would come to my church and listen to me preach my sermons week after week.  I&#8217;m encouraged that some folks actually take what I say to heart and literally respond by doing something they wouldn&#8217;t have done otherwise.  I&#8217;m humbled that I have the opportunity to touch lives each week in this way, realizing that in myself I have nothing to offer.  If anything &#8220;comes out of it&#8221; it will take cooperation with God by both preacher and listeners.<br \/>\nTake Away: Preaching must be much more than entertaining.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Preachers and listeners Ezekiel 33: They love to hear you talk, but nothing comes out of it.
