It concerns a man and his concubine. The story contains deviant sexual behavior, rape, and murder. The result is a civil war in which the tribe of Benjamin is practically wiped out. One question asked during the story should ring in our ears: &#8220;How did this outrageous evil happen?&#8221; How did the descendants of Abraham, this miraculously freed nation of slaves, these recipients of the Ten Commandments, these people chosen to be God&#8217;s very own come to this? The answer is &#8220;self and sin.&#8221; Their faith hasn\u2019t been passed on to their children. Their heroes become more and more flawed. God is forgotten and their society begins to unravel. The writer of Judges concludes in the famous epitaph of the book: &#8220;At that time there was no king in Israel. People did whatever they felt like doing.&#8221; That, my friends, is a recipe for disaster. I&#8217;d better not read this with a detached sense of superiority. I live in a society in which &#8220;doing whatever one feels like doing&#8221; is the norm. We want a convenient God who does our bidding, but leaves us alone the rest of the time. When Israel tries that the result is disaster. Do we really think we can get away with it?<br \/>\nTake Away: Whether we\u2019re talking about an individual or a nation, it\u2019s foolish to attempt to live apart from God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pitiful Judges 20: How did this outrageous evil happen?
