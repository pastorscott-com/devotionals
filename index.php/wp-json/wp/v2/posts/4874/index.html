David is king and it\u2019s certainly reasonable that a king have an idea of the population of his kingdom.  After doing some reading about this, I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s not the census that displeases God.  Rather, it\u2019s the purpose of it.  Throughout his life David has been delivered by the Lord again and again.  This census is designed to count the number of fighting men who are available to him.  In other words, rather than trusting God to be his protector, David\u2019s numbering his potential army.  When I remember that this is late in David&#8217;s life I conclude that this might be an acceptable thing for someone less experienced with God but it\u2019s not acceptable for David.  Or put more simply, David\u2019s old enough to know better.  God expects us to mature in our relationship with him.   For instance, in Matthew 16 Jesus reprimands his disciples for their lack of faith.  He tells them that they\u2019ve seen the 5000 and then the 4000 fed and it\u2019s time to for them to get a handle on the fact that God supplies the needs of our lives, both physical and spiritual.  As I read the story of David&#8217;s census I see that, as a person who\u2019s seen his share of what God can do I\u2019m expected to trust him more, and if I won&#8217;t do that, God will be displeased with me.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord expects us to grow in our relationship with him \u2013 to learn to trust him more \u2013 to be more and more secure in our walk with him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a time for simple faith 1 Chronicles 21: I want to know the number.
