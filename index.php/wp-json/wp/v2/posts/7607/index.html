He\u2019s moved forward in his sermon and is thinking about how the world as we know it will come to an end.  He pictures a great final battle when God\u2019s Judgment will fall over the earth.  Joel says the forces of evil will come to do battle against the forces of God and that the Almighty will respond in full force, shaking the earth and sky in one unforgettable blow that will spell the end of all opposition to his Kingdom.  Lest his own people fear that day, the Lord promises to, himself, be a \u201csafe hiding place\u201d for all who trust in him.  We\u2019re told that the end result of all this will be that \u201cGod has moved into Zion for good.\u201d  The fact is that natural disasters will come and go as the pages of history are turned.  Most of the time, I\u2019m merely a concerned spectator, watching from the sidelines.  Some of the time, I can involve myself in some relief effort.  Once in a while, maybe only once in a lifetime, I will find myself unhappily at the epicenter of it all.  This passage reminds me that an event much greater than any of that is out there on the horizon of history.  On that day everything&#8217;s going to come crashing down as Good and evil clash in a Creation-shaking battle.  There&#8217;ll be no storm shelter secure enough and no place remote enough to protect me from it all.  My only hope of safety is in God.  As I live my life in him, I not only find strength for the unwelcome ordinary trials and tribulations of life, but shelter against this, the biggest storm of all.<br \/>\nTake Away: My only hope of safety is in the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The only real security Joel 3: God is a safe hiding place.
