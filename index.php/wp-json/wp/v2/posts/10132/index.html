Abraham goes out to fight a great battle which he wins by the help of God. As he returns with the people he\u2019s rescued and the spoils of the battle this \u201cking of Salem\u201d greets him. Abraham, the man with the promise of God, treats him as a priest, giving him a tithe of the spoils and receives a blessing from him. It will be centuries before Abraham\u2019s descendants will have a formal priesthood and the case could be made that if anyone&#8217;s positioned as a priest it would be Abraham, not this otherwise unknown man. The Hebrews writer concludes that Melchizedek was ordained to the priesthood by none other than the Lord and that in him we have a priesthood that operates completely outside the Levitical priesthood of Israel. Then, many centuries later, another priest who&#8217;s outside the Levitical tradition appears. In a much greater way, he serves in the priestly role. This great priest makes the ultimate sacrifice for sins and thus blesses all people. The writer of Hebrews connects the dots for us that here\u2019s another priest ordained, not because of lineage and not by man, but by God\u2019s own decree. In Jesus we have a never ending, absolutely effective, God-ordained priest.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Jesus is our high priest. We need no other.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The mystery priest of the Bible Hebrews 7: God intervened and called this new, permanent priesthood into being.
