The evidence for conviction is overwhelming and the conclusion is obvious. God&#8217;s only choice is to turn his back and to declare &#8220;no&#8221; to them and their sin as they\u2019ve declared \u201cno\u201d to him. Reading this chapter not only condemns the people of ancient Israel and justifies God in his abandonment of them, but it also frightens me. How far can a nation push God? How many of his blessings can it forget? How many of his Laws can it break before the Almighty is fed up? My nation is foolishly testing the patience of God right now. Second Kings 17 is not before us as just some dusty old history lesson. It&#8217;s a warning that we&#8217;d better heed.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we say \u201cno\u201d often enough, the Lord will take us at our word.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guilty as charged 2Kings 17: In the end, God spoke a final No to Israel and turned his back on them.
