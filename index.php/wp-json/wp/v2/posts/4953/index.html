Now it\u2019s Manasseh\u2019s turn. He messes up \u2013 \u201croyally!\u201d Under his leadership the descendants of Abraham turn back to the idol worship of the past. He even brings disgusting idols right into the Temple his father had so carefully restored. It\u2019s as Manasseh&#8217;s doing these stupid things that we find a chilling statement. The Scripture reports: \u201cAnd God was angry.\u201d Tell you what; if you\u2019re doing your own thing and ignoring God you really don\u2019t want to hear these words! The result is that God allows Assyria to accomplish what they were kept from accomplishing before. Jerusalem falls before this regional power. Manasseh, himself, is led off like a farm animal to distant Babylon, likely destined for execution. To Manasseh it seems that this just might be a good time to pray! Well, to be honest about it, it is way past time for him to pray; but pray he does. He falls on his knees and cries out to God, repenting \u201ctotally\u201d of his sins. If one thing you really don\u2019t want to hear about yourself is that \u201cGod is angry\u201d the sweetest sound that can fall upon the ear is what we read here: \u201cAs he prayed, God was touched.\u201d Manasseh shouldn\u2019t have messed up in the first place. His life would have been vastly better had he been true to the God of his father. However, once he messed up, the next best thing was to pray a prayer of absolute, from-the-heart repentance. Such prayers always touch the heart of God. It\u2019s true for Manasseh. It\u2019s true for you and me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Better to not mess up in the first place, but if you\u2019ve messed up it\u2019s time to pray like you\u2019ve never prayed before.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Better late than never 2 Chronicles 33: As he prayed, God was touched.
