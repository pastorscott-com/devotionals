Things are going to get bad as a firestorm of God&#8217;s wrath is on the agenda.  Who can survive such a purging?  How does a person prepare for it?  Isaiah has a list for all who will listen: &#8220;live right, speak the truth, despise exploitation, refuse bribes, reject violence, and avoid evil amusements.&#8221;  This, he says, is the way through the storm, the way to stability and satisfaction.  I know that some things about God are complicated and it takes a lifetime of serious study and application to master them.  However, some things are pretty straight forward and this list is an example of that.  The Lord expects us to &#8220;live right.&#8221;  That is, we can drop the excuses and commit ourselves to, as best we can, doing the things we know we should do.  That isn&#8217;t all there is to it, but it\u2019s a pretty good start.  Soon enough we&#8217;ll realize that our best isn&#8217;t good enough, but it does turn us in the right direction and with that done, we&#8217;ll find ourselves aligned with God&#8217;s grace which is freely extended to us.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord expects us to &#8220;live right.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To do list Isaiah 33: The answer&#8217;s simple: live right.
