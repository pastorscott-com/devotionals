Isaiah&#8217;s picture of the Lord isn&#8217;t quite as comforting.  Things start off that way though.  God says, &#8220;I&#8217;m available, ready to be found and reaching out day after day to even those who turn their backs and walk away.&#8221;  Know what? We&#8217;d better keep reading.  In that same message the Lord says he\u2019s sick of them and their home made religion.  Even while God has been waiting he\u2019s been watching and as he watches he takes note of all the rebellion that\u2019s going on.  It may be that the most important words in this message aren\u2019t that God has continued to reach out to them even in their sin.  Rather, the words that arrest our attention ought to be, &#8220;I&#8217;m not putting up with this any longer.&#8221;  It\u2019s one thing for a person to have honest doubts and even honest misconceptions about the Lord and how he works in this world.  It is something else to take the patience of mercy of God for granted.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t take for granted the mercy and patience of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Better pay attention Isaiah 65: I reached out day after day to a people who turned their backs on me.
