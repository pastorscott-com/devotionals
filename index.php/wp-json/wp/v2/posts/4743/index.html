During this time the angel of the Lord has ministered to him and he\u2019s traveled 40 days across the wilderness to Horeb which is the mountain range that includes Sinai where Moses met God and was given the Law. In other words, Elijah has retreated to holy ground. Here, even as Moses encountered God, Elijah has an encounter of his own. This meeting though, starts very differently. For Moses, there were earthquakes and thick smoke. For Elijah, things start with God asking him a question, &#8220;So, Elijah, what are you doing here?&#8221; With that, Elijah begins to state his discouragement, loneliness, and fear. The big stuff is still coming but I\u2019m taken with just this today. I know that prayer should generally start with words of worship and reverence. Sometimes, though, we\u2019re so broken and confused that we can hardly bring ourselves to pray at all. Sometimes we have to travel out into the wilderness for a while possibly ending up at some place that&#8217;s significant to us. And then, it isn&#8217;t us but God who starts a conversation that doesn&#8217;t begin with &#8220;Our Father who art in heaven&#8221; but instead with words of pain. Know what? That\u2019s okay with God. Take note of just who it is that asks the opening question here.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our prayers are going nowhere if they don\u2019t come from an honest heart.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praying when in pain 1Kings 19: Elijah, what are you doing here?
