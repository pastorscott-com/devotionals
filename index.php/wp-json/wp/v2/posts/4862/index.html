This time things will be different because he&#8217;s paying better attention to the details.  There\u2019s nothing like the Ark in Christianity.  Many traditions have holy objects but none of them are revered as was the Ark.  There\u2019s a reminder here of the importance of sacred places and things.  For instance, there are places that are special to me because I\u2019ve had especially powerful encounters with God in them.  Maybe you have your mother\u2019s old Bible and just holding it causes you to feel not only closer to her, but to the Lord.  These things aren&#8217;t the same as the Ark or, later on, the Temple\u2019s Holy of Holies.  Still, though, as I see David making plans to move the Ark, I\u2019m reminded of the power of some things that have been used by the Lord to connect me to him.  I don\u2019t worship them, but they are precious to me.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s a good thing to be reminded of times and places where the Lord has seemed especially near.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Precious memories 1 Chronicles 15: God exploded in anger at us because we didn&#8217;t make proper preparation and follow instructions.
