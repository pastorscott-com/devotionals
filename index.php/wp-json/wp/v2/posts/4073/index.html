When Abraham says he\u2019s heard from God and that they\u2019re to relocate Sarah&#8217;s likely both concerned and excited. The promise of bearing a son fills this barren woman with sweet anticipation. The journey has taken much longer than she ever thought it would. Twenty-five years have passed and the excitement and anticipation has given way to weariness and disappointment. Now Abraham has the nerve to tell her he\u2019s heard from the Lord again and that the promised child will be born in about a year. She laughs and it isn\u2019t the laughter of joy. Instead, we hear a hard, brittle laugh \u2013 laughing at the impossible. This, though, isn\u2019t the last time we hear laughter from Sarah. A year later, we hear her laughing again and this time it\u2019s the laughter of one who&#8217;s had a miracle of God happen in her life. This is such a happy occasion that the miracle baby is named \u201cTo Laugh\u201d or \u201cIsaac.\u201d Here we see that God loves surprise endings, jokes with good punch lines. And his laughter is not silliness or useless. God loves to bring about happy endings. What laughter does he want to produce in my life today? As I trust him and cooperate with him, he\u2019ll accomplish good things and bring a smile to my face.<br \/>\nTake away: The Lord delights in surprising us with good things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sarah laughed Genesis 18: Sarah laughed within herself.
