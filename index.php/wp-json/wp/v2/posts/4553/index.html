He&#8217;s turned his back on me. He refuses to do what I tell him.&#8221;<br \/>\nGod has given Saul explicit orders. He\u2019s to attack Amalek and utterly destroy all life. Saul leads his army into the battle and follows God&#8217;s command. Well, not quite. Agag, king of Amalek, is captured rather than killed. Also, some of the choice animals are brought back alive. Now, I\u2019m troubled by all this killing and I\u2019ve written about it before so I\u2019m going to move on to another important feature of this passage. God says he\u2019s &#8220;sorry&#8221; he made Saul king in the first place. Some say that this is just God speaking in human terms, that he isn&#8217;t &#8220;sorry&#8221; in the sense that he regrets having made Saul king. The reason that they believe this is because taking this statement at face value doesn&#8217;t fit their theology. They see time as somehow pre-existent and that God can see into the future. &#8220;God knows everything,&#8221; they say, &#8220;so he has to know the future.&#8221; I think that such logic contains a fatal error: that the future already exists as something to be known. If time is a &#8220;thing&#8221; then, no doubt, God knows all about it. But if time is simply a measure of the flow of events, and if human beings really have free will, then God doesn&#8217;t know the future. Before you drag me out to be stoned, let me add two things. First, God knows what he\u2019s going to do. Throughout the Bible he says, &#8220;If you do this, I will do that &#8212; if you do that I will do this.&#8221; God knows, because he\u2019s going to act, not because he\u2019s looked into the future and seen what he\u2019s going to do but, instead, because he\u2019s God Almighty and if says he\u2019s going to do something that thing is absolutely certain to happen. Second, God could know the exact future if he wanted to. I am not saying that he somehow &#8220;limits his vision.&#8221; Rather, that if God wanted to force events to flow in a specific way he has the power to do so. However, doing that in the lives of individuals would violate the free will he granted human beings. If you\u2019re still with me, let me conclude by adding that God had every reason to believe Saul would be a terrific leader of Israel and to be disappointed when he isn\u2019t. In fact, that\u2019s what God believed would (or at least &#8220;could&#8221;) happen. Saul&#8217;s failure disappointed the Almighty but it didn&#8217;t ruin his plan. The Lord goes about replacing Saul with another king, giving Israel a second chance.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord may not pre-ordain what I\u2019m going to do, but he can handle whatever I do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Future knowledge 1 Samuel 15: Then God spoke to Samuel: &#8220;I\u2019m sorry I ever made Saul king.
