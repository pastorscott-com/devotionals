The Bible also mentions the &#8220;sons of Asaph.&#8221;  These are probably people who are disciples of this talented worship leader.  Asaph and David are kindred spirits and the themes of their psalms are similar.  In this song Asaph declares the goodness of God and talks about how the Lord patiently led him even when he was &#8220;totally ignorant&#8221; of what was going on.  It\u2019s the opening part of this psalm, though, that gets my attention today.  He declares the goodness of God but then confesses that he nearly missed seeing that goodness.  Why?  He was too busy looking at people to see God.  Asaph&#8217;s attention was drawn to the seeming success of others, then, as he considered their success he saw that some were wicked people and he began to question God as to how it could be that wicked people enjoy such success.  The truth is that I can fail to see God because I\u2019m enamored with the success of others.  I can also fail to see him because I am too busy telling him what I think he should do.  In trying to help God out I place myself in danger of losing sight of him altogether.  I need to remember who God is and that he can handle the inconsistencies of life.  My main job is to keep my eyes on him and live in obedience to him.  It\u2019s not my job to point out things I think he may have overlooked.<br \/>\nTake Away: Always remember that the Lord can handle the seeming inconsistencies of life \u2013 we can leave such things in his hands and keep our eyes on him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Helping God be God Psalm 73: I nearly missed it&#8230;I was looking the other way, looking up to the people.
