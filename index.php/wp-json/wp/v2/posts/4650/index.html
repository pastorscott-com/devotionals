Still, David has friends. Hushai takes his life in his hands to not only be a spy in Absalom\u2019s court, but even offers Absalom bad advice as he makes plans to go after his father. Jonathan and Ahimaaz and an unnamed servant girl serve as couriers. A woman at Bahurim helps these couriers hide. Meanwhile, others are providing provisions for David and those who have fled with him. Before long they have \u201croasted grain, beans and lentils, honey, and curds and cheese\u201d thanks to Shobi, Makir, and Barzillai. Know what? As I type the names of these people the spell checker on my computer is going crazy. Apparently, my computer has never heard of Hushai or Ahimaaz or Makir. Maybe you haven\u2019t heard of them either. These people aren\u2019t major figures in history so their names aren\u2019t well known. However, on this day as David flees for his life, they all play vital roles. You might say that they each rise to the occasion. The fact is that there are a lot more people like dear brother Barzillai and the woman at Bahurim than there are people like David. I identify with that crowd and maybe you do too. We may not get the headlines, but, if we\u2019re faithful to do the right thing at the right time, we might just make a major, if unnoticed difference in the world.<br \/>\nTake Away: Not all heroes are famous.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unknown heroes 2 Samuel 17: Shobi&#8230;Makir&#8230;and Barzillai&#8230;brought beds and blankets, bowls and jugs filled with wheat, barley&#8230;.
