Hopefully, my son doesn&#8217;t feel that growing up in a parsonage was all that bad.  However, I&#8217;ve heard some horror stories from &#8220;PK&#8217;s.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve concluded that while some of those stories are true, some are simply basic &#8220;growing up&#8221; stories that could be applied to just about any family.  However, Hosea&#8217;s kids have some no-questions-asked horror stories.  For one thing, their dad gives them strange names intended to preach a sermon.  Two of the three, in particular, get terrible names: a daughter named &#8220;No-Mercy&#8221; and a son who gets the awful name of &#8220;Nobody.&#8221;  I bet those kids needed therapy!  Every time the girl is called it\u2019s to be a sermon warning that unless the nation repents God will show them &#8220;no mercy.&#8221;  When the boy is named it\u2019s intended to declare that this &#8220;chosen people&#8221; is on the verge of being kicked out and becoming &#8220;nobody&#8221; in the sight of God.  There&#8217;s a ray of sunshine near the end of the first chapter and continuing into the second.  As a person might look across the hot and deadly desert to the distant cool mountains, Hosea looks down the road to a day of restoration.  One thing he sees is a day for new names.  When the discipline of God has done its work, children, and the whole nation, will be worthy of new names like &#8220;God&#8217;s Somebody&#8221; and &#8220;All Mercy.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: I\u2019m glad I live on the \u201call mercy\u201d side of this story.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These preacher\u2019s kids had it hard Hosea 2: Rename your brothers &#8220;God&#8217;s Somebody.&#8221; I&#8217;m not a preacher&#8217;s kid, but I raised one!
