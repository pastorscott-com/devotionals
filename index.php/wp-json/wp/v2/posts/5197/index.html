I find it challenging to write devotionally from material that\u2019s already devotional in the first place!  I can get my teeth into a passage that has a story in it but scripture like the Psalms is more challenging to me.  Because of that I\u2019ve hopped and skipped my way along and I know I haven&#8217;t done this book of the Bible anything close to the justice it deserves.  Today, I find myself at this final Psalm and it stirs a good memory.  When I was in high school I was a member of the band and at a banquet for the band I was asked to bring a short devotional (yes, we did stuff like that in public school back in the olden days!).  I picked this Psalm and had fun reading about all the instruments that can be used to praise the Lord.  After the banquet one of my fellow band members complained to me that I didn&#8217;t mention his instrument, the saxophone.  We laughed about it at the time, but here I am decades later remembering that event and being reminded that there are all kinds of ways to worship: playing the trumpet, drama, singing, preaching, and, yes, even by playing the saxophone!  The psalm writer sums it all up by saying, to put it in my own words, &#8220;Just do it!&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Whatever it is you have \u2013 musical ability, teaching ability, using a hammer and saw\u2014whatever you have, find ways to use it in praising the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praise God with the sound of the saxophone Psalm 150: Praise with the blast on the trumpet.
