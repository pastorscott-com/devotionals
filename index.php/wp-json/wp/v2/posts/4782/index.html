When they arrive at the camp they\u2019re surprised to find that there\u2019s no one there! God has moved bringing terror to their camp. The mighty army has fled in panic not even knowing why they were running. The lepers have the time of their lives, eating their fill and ransacking the place. It\u2019s at that point that one of them says to his friends, &#8220;We aren&#8217;t doing right. Back in Samaria people are starving to death while we\u2019re enjoying all this bounty.&#8221; This real life story is also a parable for Christians everywhere. Like the lepers we\u2019ve discovered something wonderful. Meanwhile there\u2019s a world that desperately needs to know what we know.
