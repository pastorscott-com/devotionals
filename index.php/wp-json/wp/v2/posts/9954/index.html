One of those seeking our Lord\u2019s attention is a respected member of the community, Jairus.  His daughter is very sick and he asks Jesus to come and heal her.  Jesus agrees, but along the way a woman \u201csteals\u201d a miracle, touching the fringe of Jesus\u2019 clothes.  This delays Jesus and, while everyone else is enjoying the miracle the woman experienced, Jairus receives the bad news that it\u2019s too late and his daughter has died.  It\u2019s now that Jesus tells Jairus to ignore their words and trust him.  The Lord goes to his home and in a private audience raises the twelve year old back to life.  The words of the Lord to Jairus speak to my heart today.  How often the voices of circumstance or experience sadly report that there\u2019s nothing that will help and I might as well throw in the towel and cope as best I can.  In the midst of discouragement Jesus says, \u201cDon\u2019t listen.  Don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t doubt.  Instead, look at me.  Focus; remember who I am and what I can do.  Remember that I love you and I wouldn\u2019t let you get into this situation if I didn\u2019t have the authority to see you through it.  Trust me.\u201d  These brief words to Jairus are packed with power and hope.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Remember who Jesus is; look to him even in the impossible moments of life.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Power packed words Mark 5: Don\u2019t listen to them; just trust me.
