He\u2019s already insisted that to be a follower of God requires more than words or even sincere desire. Again, \u201clove,\u201d to him is an \u201caction\u201d word rather than a \u201cfeelings\u201d word. To love God is to love the Son and to love the Son is to love those he\u2019s brought into the family of God. So what does it mean to love the children of God? Immediately, John takes us back to action. I love God\u2019s people, not by feeling a certain way about them but, rather, by treating them in a certain way. John reminds me that God has given me some commandments concerning how I\u2019m to treat my brothers and sisters. If I love God, I\u2019ll keep those commandments and in doing so I\u2019ll \u201clove\u201d those who are part of this great family of God. If I want proof of my love of God I\u2019ll find it in how I treat his people. John adds that this isn\u2019t that big a deal because this \u201clove in action\u201d that\u2019s required of me isn\u2019t all that troubling. I\u2019m to love people as I love myself. That is, I\u2019m to care about the needs of their lives, their comfort, and their security. Loving self isn\u2019t about feeling a certain way about myself but is, rather, about the action I take on my own behalf. That\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m to love God\u2019s people.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: To learn about your relationship with God, take a good look at your relationship to his people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Loving the people of God 1John 5: The proof that we love God comes when we keep his commandments and they are not at all troublesome.
