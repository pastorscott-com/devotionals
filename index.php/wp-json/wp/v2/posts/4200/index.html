You\u2019ll burn out\u2026you can\u2019t do this alone.<br \/>\nMoses is overwhelmed by his responsibilities yet he presses on.  From morning to night he deals with the issues of leadership as this nation of former slaves struggles with issues of personal responsibility.  Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, visits and sees what\u2019s happening.  Moses needs to get organized by surrounding himself with capable assistants.  That will be best for him, for the people of God, and even for the leaders he enlists.  To do otherwise is to invite disaster because Moses does have a job to do and if he burns himself out trying to do everything he&#8217;ll end up doing nothing.  Moses accepts the word of wisdom from Jethro and surrounds himself with competent, God-fearing, loyal people.  I think we pastors sometimes have a \u201cMoses complex.\u201d  It isn\u2019t entirely our fault.  The \u201chigher-ups\u201d are very pastor focused and our lay people will cheer us right into the grave as we try to do it all.  We\u2019re wise to spend some time listening to old Jethro and begin handing some things off to good people who are likely more gifted in specific areas than we are anyway.  That will free them up to do what God gifted them to do and it will also let us focus our energy doing what we\u2019re called to do in the first place.<br \/>\nTake Away: Leadership doesn\u2019t mean doing everything.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having a Moses Complex Exodus 18: This is no way to go about it.
