Two women have some differences, about what, we don\u2019t know.  These women have partnered with Paul in proclaiming the Good News.  They&#8217;re faithful laborers in the vineyard of the Lord and their names are in the book of life.  Paul urges a third party to get involved, helping them work through their differences.  That\u2019s about it.  Paul doesn\u2019t take sides and he declares both of these women as \u201cokay\u201d in both his eyes and in the eyes of the Lord.  So, what do we have here?  First, there\u2019s the reminder that even the best of God\u2019s people can sometimes fail to get along.  God\u2019s people, even the saved and sanctified ones, don\u2019t always agree and sometimes their disagreements can be intense.  Second, when we do disagree we\u2019re to do all we can to work through it.  That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that one person yields to the other, although it may mean exactly that.  At some point, two Christians need to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work through this, otherwise, we\u2019ll be diminished for it and Christ\u2019s kingdom will suffer.\u201d  Third, sometimes it takes a third party, a mutual friend, respected by both to get the ball rolling.  To tell the truth, I wouldn\u2019t want to be Syzgus here.  His name means \u201cyokefellow,\u201d thus, \u201cco-worker.\u201d  What man wants to get between two women who need to \u201ciron out their differences and make up\u201d?  The answer is: the kind of man who&#8217;s a real friend of, and is respected by, both women.  Paul gives this good man the assignment of bringing these two together to work things out, not because their salvation&#8217;s in jeopardy, but because the journey is better together than it is apart, and, because when we&#8217;re real \u201cyokefellows\u201d we can accomplish more for God.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If there\u2019s an unresolved issue between you and a fellow Christian, don\u2019t pass \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t collect $200\u201d until you\u2019ve gone to them and worked it out.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can\u2019t we all just get along?
