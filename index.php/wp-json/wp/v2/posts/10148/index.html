The pulpit committee has a list of pastoral qualifications and they\u2019re sifting through applicants. They want an experienced pastor who still has children at home. The new pastor needs to be a good preacher, but who&#8217;s also a people person who&#8217;ll get along well with the diverse congregation. It\u2019s not a bad idea to have such a list but Peter\u2019s qualifications for church leaders ought to be prominently in the mix. He urges pastors to see themselves as shepherds who are dedicated to caring for God\u2019s flock. He expects them to be servants who aren\u2019t always trying to figure out ways to get more money or leverage over the congregation. He wants them to be tender in spirit and be good examples for God\u2019s people. It would be nice to have a pastor with the right mix of youth and maturity, who is studious in sermon preparation but is also a people person. Still, I can\u2019t help but think Peter\u2019s criteria trumps all the above. A church with such a pastor is blessed indeed.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Ultimately the Lord\u2019s list of pastoral qualifications is the one that makes the most sense.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pulpit committee 1Peter 5: I have a special concern for you church leaders.
