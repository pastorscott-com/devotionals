I haven\u2019t been a fan of the show.  In fact, I don&#8217;t think I\u2019ve ever seen an entire episode.  Honestly, now that I know more what it is about my attitude toward it has softened a bit.  It&#8217;s basically a modern version of Ted Mack&#8217;s Amateur Hour (you can look it up if it\u2019s a strange name to you!).  Do you want to know why I never started watching &#8220;American Idol&#8221;?  It\u2019s the name of the show!  As soon as I saw it the Commandment, &#8220;Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image&#8221; sprang to mind.  Really!  As anyone would, I guessed the premise of the show, but the name left a sour taste in my mouth so I never bothered checking it out.  Of course, Isaiah isn&#8217;t thinking about entertainers when he warns his fellow countrymen to stop &#8220;idolizing&#8221; people but if he had had access to 140 channels of TV I think he would have been pretty specific in warning us about our attitude concerning everyone from sports stars to singers to actors to politicians.  I&#8217;m not against people being impressed by a golfer who can drop the ball within two feet of the hole from 150 yards out, but really, he or she is nothing to get excited about.  The same people who will rise before daylight to get a prime spot for watching some golf star tee off don&#8217;t even bother to attend a worship service in hopes that the King of Kings will make an appearance.  Now that&#8217;s having mixed up priorities.<br \/>\nTake Away: The warnings about idols should cause us to do a priority check.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who it is that America should be worshiping Isaiah 2: Quit scraping and fawning over mere humans&#8230;can&#8217;t you see there&#8217;s nothing to them? &#8220;American Idol&#8221; is a TV show that gets a lot of attention.
