There\u2019s a whole lot of ugly stuff and even when we read devotionally we don\u2019t come away with anything like a cup of sugar!  Jehu\u2019s role in the story is an interesting one.  He\u2019s called to be God\u2019s avenger.  Because of Ahab of Israel\u2019s wickedness Jehu\u2019s given the job of hunting down and killing all his family.  Now, Ahaziah becomes king of Judah and he stupidly follows in the footsteps of his father.  Rather than looking to his grandfather, Jehoshaphat, for an example he connects himself to Ahab\u2019s clan and, in the words of this passage, \u201cattended the sin school of Ahab, and graduated with a degree in doom.\u201d  That puts him on the radar screen of the man who\u2019s mainly been concerned with cleaning up the wickedness associated with the throne of Israel.  Now, as the king of Judah enters into the orbit of Ahab, Jehu takes note.  When he has the opportunity God\u2019s executioner corners Ahaziah and kills him.  As I said, some of these stories don\u2019t make us feel all warm and fuzzy!  Ahaziah foolishly associated himself with the wrong people, was then counted as one of them, and then paid the same price that they paid.  A take away from this less-than-encouraging passage is that we\u2019d better be careful in choosing our best friends and who we allow to influence our lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: Choices have consequences.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s avenger 2 Chronicles 22: And Jehu killed him.
