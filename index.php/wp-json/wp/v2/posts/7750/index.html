I have to confess that it\u2019s pretty much that way for me. I\u2019ve read through the book a few times, usually as part of a read-the-Bible-in-a-year effort. Its three chapters make it less than one day\u2019s reading in such a program. The introduction of the book is somewhat unique because we&#8217;re given four generations of Zephaniah\u2019s family tree, concluding with Hezekiah, likely the well-known king of Judah. If that\u2019s so, it helps us see that, unlike Amos and other prophets who speak for the common man, Zephaniah\u2019s royal blood gives him a different perspective and audience. He ministers during the reign of Josiah, possibly, then having influence along with Jeremiah on the young king. Zephaniah is especially focused in on the Day of Judgment that&#8217;s coming upon, not only Judah, but upon the whole earth. Why such a day is coming, what will happen when it does, and how to prepare for it is subject matter for his message. Since Zephaniah speaks of not only a contemporary time of judgment but a more distant one as well I can consider his message as not only a historical one, but one that needs to be heard today.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even the most minor of prophets has a major message for us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The least known book of the Bible Zephaniah 1: I\u2019m going to make a clean sweep of the earth.
