After all, it\u2019s filled with imperfect human beings.  Within its number are mature, settled saints and new, raw believers and folks everywhere in between.  It\u2019s a challenge to be a part of such a diverse family.  The Apostle reminds the \u201ctrained\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d believers that they have a responsibility to enter into \u201ca generous common life\u201d with those who&#8217;ve gone before and at least implies that they\u2019re to do the same with those who are trailing behind them on their spiritual journey.  He knows that this kind of communal living takes effort and can be a real energy drain so he frames the issue using a familiar crop growing illustration.  The farmer works the fields, not because he likes what he\u2019s seeing right at that moment but because of what he believes is coming.  As \u201cseasoned saints\u201d patiently love and encourage others within the body of Christ they do so with two truths in mind.  First, they remember where they came from and how others accepted them when they were young, frustrating, inconsistent believers.  Second, they anticipate what the Lord&#8217;s going to do in the lives of these folks.  The language he uses is that of self-responsibility: \u201cLet\u2019s not allow ourselves&#8230;\u201d he says.  Some folks haven\u2019t yet gotten beyond the children\u2019s end of the pool.   Those who are experienced, capable \u201cswimmers\u201d are to, in Paul\u2019s words, \u201cWork for the benefit of all, starting with the people closest to us in the community of faith.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: There are people at all stages of spiritual growth in the family of God.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Responsibility of seasoned saints Galatians 6: So let\u2019s not allow ourselves to get fatigued doing good.
