The Lord\u2019s displeased with the spiritual leaders of Jeremiah&#8217;s day.  He pictures them as shepherds who are given the responsibility of caring for the Lord\u2019s flock.  These leaders are entrusted with the spiritual welfare of God&#8217;s flock but they\u2019re betraying that confidence.  Instead of loving the flock, leading and caring for it, they&#8217;re taking advantage of things for personal gain.  In some cases they&#8217;re actually harming those they\u2019re supposed to protect.  Otherwise, they&#8217;re neglecting them or even driving them away.  God\u2019s disappointed in these leaders and is angry with them.  Sometimes I think that church people are too pastor oriented, giving way too much authority to the pastor, including letting the pastor do their thinking for them (or, standing on the sidelines and cheering as the pastor works him\/herself to death &#8211; but that&#8217;s a subject for another day!).  Today, I&#8217;m reminded that there&#8217;s a strong biblical foundation that supports some having spiritual leadership.  The Lord has wired us in such a way that we look to some as &#8220;shepherds&#8221; acting as God&#8217;s representatives.   These leaders are to be servants who put the interests of those entrusted to their care before their own needs.  In this passage Jeremiah reminds me that as a pastor I&#8217;ve been honored with the position of leadership, but with that position has come accountability, not just to the congregation I serve, but to the Lord, himself.<br \/>\nTake Away: Church leaders are to be good shepherds of the flock of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pastoral responsibilities Jeremiah 23: You&#8217;ve scattered my sheep&#8230;you haven&#8217;t kept your eye on them.
