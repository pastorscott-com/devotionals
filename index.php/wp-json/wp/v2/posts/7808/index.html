The \u201cmulligan\u201d morphed into an after-the-fact point of grace, first, for the opening shot only and then to any one tee shot during the round.  I\u2019ve even played golf with some folks who took however many \u201cmulligans\u201d they wanted.  My response has always been, \u201cYou can take as many second shots as you want as long as you don\u2019t brag about your score!\u201d  I\u2019m reminded that out in real life we don\u2019t get many mulligans.  Once in a while we do, for instance, when the traffic cop lets us off with a warning.  However, if my poor driving has resulted in a car wreck the clock can\u2019t be turned back and there\u2019s no mulligan for me.  God\u2019s man Zechariah has good news for Israel.  The Lord&#8217;s going to give them another chance.  He\u2019s going to gather this scattered nation from all the places where it&#8217;s landed and give it a fresh start.  We serve a God who graciously gives nations and individuals second chances.  When I confess my sin and failure and return to the Lord, I find that he delights in forgiving me and restoring me to his family.  In golf, the mulligan is just an unofficial part of a game.  With God, it\u2019s the real deal and it happens only because of his grace.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God, golf, and grace Zechariah 10: They\u2019ll get a fresh start, as if nothing had ever happened.
