As Moses preaches the people are looking across the Jordan to the Promised Land.  They know who lives there and they know that their army isn\u2019t ready to face the superior forces of Canaan.  Beyond that, Moses, who is the only leader they\u2019ve ever known, isn\u2019t going with them.   The new battles will be fought without their old leader.  Well, not quite.  Their real Leader is not only right there with them; he\u2019s already confidently marching ahead of them preparing the way in places like Jericho.  When Moses at 120 years of age breathes his last God will remain their strong leader.  Even as Moses is about to commission his successor, Joshua, he reminds his listeners of God&#8217;s faithfulness to them.  I thank God for people who have influenced my life by providing vital spiritual leadership along the way.  Even more important, though, is the awesome steadiness of God.  The finest, most dedicated person has their limits, but not the Lord.  As Moses says, &#8220;He won&#8217;t let you down; he won&#8217;t leave you.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is our faithful Leader and as we follow him, we can do so with confidence that he won\u2019t let us down and he\u2019ll never forsake us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Follow the Leader Deuteronomy 31: Be strong.
