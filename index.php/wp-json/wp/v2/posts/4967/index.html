Now, the new residents (and I say &#8220;new&#8221; guardedly because they&#8217;ve been there over 60 years) view the presence and work of the Jews with suspicion and hostility. At first these people offer to participate in the project, but it\u2019s almost certainly an offer made with ulterior motives. When that fails, they go to work trying to stop the work. At one point they even hire people to give their time to discouraging the builders and those &#8220;discouragers&#8221; pretty much succeed. For 15 years the big project limps along and then, thanks to a carefully worded letter to the new king, the work is stopped altogether. This incident is a good reminder that we should never deceive ourselves into thinking that because we&#8217;re doing the right thing and giving sacrificially to the work of God that things are going to go smoothly. For one thing there are some &#8220;professional propagandists&#8221; (some of them on the &#8220;inside&#8221; of things) who\u2019ll do all they can to divert our attention away from that to which we\u2019re called.<br \/>\nTake Away: Beware of listening to, or even worse, being, a professional discourager.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Professional discouragers Ezra 4: They even hired propagandists to sap their resolve.
