Rather, it\u2019s horror.  In view of a holy God he realizes his own lack of holiness.  When compared to his fellow citizens, Isaiah\u2019s a good man, even a righteous man.  However, when he finds himself in the presence of God he sees himself as he really is, and that vision brings him to his knees.  Isaiah&#8217;s words are deeply personal and my reaction to this passage, if it\u2019s honest, starts with me and not with what I perceive to be failure in others.  Jesus touches on this in the Sermon on the Mount when he says, &#8220;Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.&#8221;  Also, I note that Isaiah doesn&#8217;t announce that he\u2019s now going to commence a self-improvement campaign.  Instead, it\u2019s honest recognition of his sinful ways and deep sadness as he realizes just how broken his life is.  Isaiah, in just a few words, says it all: &#8220;I\u2019m doomed because everything about me, even my words, is unclean and unholy.  Now that I\u2019ve seen God I realize the depth of my lostness.  In myself I see no hope whatsoever.&#8221;  The hope of Isaiah isn\u2019t found within himself.  He knows it, and the Lord knows it.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s only as we\u2019re honest with ourselves and with the Lord that the Lord can begin transforming our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Moment of truth Isaiah 6: Every word I&#8217;ve ever spoken is tainted&#8230;words that corrupt and desecrate.
