Jeroboam immediately realizes that Rehoboam holds one powerful trump card. He has the Temple. Even though the people have made him king, his subjects will still go to Jerusalem to worship. Once they\u2019re in Jerusalem they\u2019ll be reminded of David and Solomon. When that happens, they\u2019ll remember that Rehoboam sits on the throne of these two great men. He solves this problem by turning his back on God and the Temple. How does he convince these worshipers of Jehovah to abandon worship at the Temple built in his Name? He does so by telling them that it\u2019s too much trouble to travel to Jerusalem to worship at the Temple. By keeping them away from the Temple he keeps them out of Judah, and by doing that, he keeps them away from Rehoboam&#8217;s influence. Of course it\u2019s a blatant sin. The people, though, go along with his suggestion. I understand the temptation because, like them, I like convenience. I like having a remote control for my TV, a microwave oven, a garage door opener. I even like having my church less than a mile from my house. Still, there are some things that are worth inconvenience. I&#8217;ll drive extra distance to see the doctor in whom I have confidence and I will go out of my way to spend some time with my grandchildren. Am I willing to be inconvenienced to worship God? Do I want a worship experience that isn&#8217;t too much trouble, or do I want to really connect with God Almighty? What value do I place on having a genuine worship experience? Thanks, but no thanks, Jeroboam. I think I&#8217;ll just go on making that trip to Jerusalem!<br \/>\nTake Away: If we have to choose between convenience and God, well, the choice is obvious.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How far is too far? 1Kings 12: It&#8217;s too much trouble for you to go to Jerusalem to worship.
