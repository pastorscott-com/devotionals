The coming danger isn\u2019t just that of invading armies but of crop failures resulting in famine in the land. Everything will be turned upside down on that day which Isaiah specifically says is just a little over a year away. With such a storm bearing down on them Isaiah says there\u2019s just one thing to do: repent and seek God. The coming disaster isn\u2019t some random event. It\u2019s the Judgment of God. It\u2019s not too late for them to change their ways and seek the Lord. Earlier, the prophet pictured God as a mighty eagle, circling high in the sky, not waiting to pounce upon some unwitting prey, but waiting to deliver. Now, he says that if sinning, God-rejecting people will repent of their sin the Lord will pour his Spirit out upon them from above. We often think of the prophets as having messages of only gloom and doom but that\u2019s only a portion of their work. In this passage we see an abundant measure of hope for even the most God-rejecting life. To this day, the Lord waits for us to look up in repentance and trust that he might pour his Spirit out on our lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: Like a circling eagle, the Lord hovers over us, waiting for an opportunity to dish out abundant mercy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Like an eagle circling high above Isaiah 32: Weep and grieve until the Spirit is poured out on us from above.
