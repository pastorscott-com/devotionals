Moses\u2019 brother and sister, Miriam and Aaron, don\u2019t like his wife.  This isn\u2019t especially earthshaking.  There are many in-laws who don\u2019t get along.  In this case, though, Moses\u2019 brother and sister go public with their family dispute, apparently undermining his leadership by pointing out that Moses is married to a non-Israelite.  It\u2019s here that we find this chilling sentence: \u201cGod overheard their talk.\u201d  Actually, this passage usually brings a smile to my face.  The statement that Moses is the most humble man on the face of the earth is quite funny when we think of the tradition that Moses is the author of Numbers.  Supposedly we have him describing himself here as the most humble man on earth!   In spite of the smile, however, this is quite a serious passage.  God doesn\u2019t like it when people undermine the leadership he&#8217;s put in place.  The issue here isn\u2019t about disagreeing with leaders, questioning some decision they&#8217;ve made.  Instead, it\u2019s about undermining God-given authority.  In this case, God doesn\u2019t like what he hears and acts to shore up his chosen leader\u2019s status by diminishing theirs.  Surely there are times when church leaders need correction but if they need to be taken down a peg or two, we\u2019d better be careful about our place in it.<br \/>\nTake Away: A God called leader remains human and prone to error but he or she also deserves respect as one set apart by the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All in the family Numbers 12: God overheard their talk.
