Soon these people will cross the Jordan River and engage the armies of the nations of Canaan.  They\u2019ll be outnumbered and will face experienced armies in numerous battles.  Moses instructs the spiritual leaders of the land to prepare God\u2019s people for battle by encouraging them to be strong and courageous.  The reason for confidence is that God is going into the battle with them.  Moses is about to depart but the Lord isn\u2019t going anywhere.  Instead, thick or thin, he\u2019ll be with them all the way.  God is never a sideline spectator to our lives.  Of course he\u2019s near when things are going well.  He\u2019s also near in the darkness of night.  As my spirit trembles he reaches out to me, reassuring me that it\u2019ll be okay because he\u2019s right here and he\u2019ll help me through it all.<br \/>\nTake Away: Everything in life changes, but God remains faithful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The water\u2019s fine, come on in Deuteronomy 20: Don\u2019t waver in resolve.
