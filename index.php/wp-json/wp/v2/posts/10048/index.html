In his day, Isaiah extolled the value of messengers who went from place to place proclaiming the message of hope to their generation. That, he says, is a beautiful thing. Paul is sorry that the people of Israel of his day aren\u2019t the \u201cmessage-proclaimers.\u201d They\u2019ve had every opportunity to play that role but instead insist on doing things their own way. They\u2019re the losers in that. Now, I read this scenario and think about my own generation. Like the messengers of Isaiah\u2019s day, the Church has Good News. We should be happily \u201ctelling all the good things of God.\u201d All too often though, like the people of Israel of Paul\u2019s day, we\u2019ve retreated to our church buildings and busied ourselves with committees and programs, hanging our shingle outside inviting those want to know more to come on in. Beyond that, we\u2019ve divided up into different camps, drawing lines and building walls. We\u2019d rather argue over finer points of the Bible than go next door to offer a cup of cold water in Jesus\u2019 name. Isaiah reminds us that it\u2019s a beautiful thing when God\u2019s people take the Good News to those who need it so desperately. Paul, though, reminds us that it\u2019s possible for those with the Good News to fumble and fail. Does this kind of thinking alarm us? It should.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Who do I know who needs the Good News?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Message-proclaimers Romans 10: Grand processions of people telling all the good things of God!
