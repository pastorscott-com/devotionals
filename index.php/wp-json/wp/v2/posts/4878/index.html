It was a big job and it was their job.  As Israel fell into the idol worship of the Book of Judges the Levites were still considered holy men, although the application of that position was a pitiful distortion of \u201choly.\u201d  Now things are coming together.  Israel\u2019s in possession of the Promised Land.  They have a King who wants nothing more than to serve and please God.  Their days of wandering in both the physical and spiritual wilderness are past.  And the days of moving the Tabernacle, including the precious Ark of the Covenant are also over.  David, displaying his organizational genius, counts the Levites and finds that there are 38,000 men of age of service.  He divides them into subgroups and begins handing out assignments in keeping with the spirit of their original assignment generations earlier.  From now on they may not have to carry the Tabernacle from place to place, but they\u2019ll be the overseers of the Tabernacle and, once it\u2019s built, the Temple.  The priests, descendants of Aaron, will handle the sacrifices and such.  These sons of Levi will take care of everything else associated with the Temple.  As I realize how much David loves the yet-to-be-built Temple and watch as he puts these Levites in charge of it I see what a compliment he\u2019s paying them.  I know it\u2019s not the same but I\u2019m reminded of the people who accept responsibilities associated with the Church.  Thank God for church treasurers, Sunday Superintendents, teachers, volunteer janitors, and many others who love the Church and faithfully give of their time, talent, and treasure.  These, I think, are the modern day Levites.<br \/>\nTake Away: Never take faithful servants for granted.  They serve the Lord just a significantly as the preachers and singers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Modern day Levites 1 Chronicles 23: The Levites no longer have to carry the Tabernacle.
