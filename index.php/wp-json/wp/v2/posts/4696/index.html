It\u2019s a truly impressive structure with every detail perfect. This house of worship is one of the wonders of the world. But that\u2019s the least of the story. What really matters is what happens next. As the dedication service is about to begin God&#8217;s glory falls on the place. His glory is so powerful that it\u2019s tangible. The Presence of God flows into and through the structure to the extent that the priests, who have assumed their assigned positions of service are driven out! Like a cloud, God&#8217;s glory has descended and the people are in reverent awe of the Lord. I\u2019ve been in church services in my life in which God came in glory and majesty. The scale was much smaller, but I\u2019ve tasted just enough to imagine what it\u2019s like on this day. In less public moments God has touched my life and these are my most precious spiritual memories. I thank him for such wonderful encounters with the divine. Beyond that, I hunger for God to pour his glory out on me and on his church. Passages like this both warm my heart and rekindle a hunger for God in the depths of my spirit.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s nothing like the presence of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Glory! 1Kings 8: The glory of God filled The Temple of God!
