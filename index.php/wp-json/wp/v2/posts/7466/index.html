He&#8217;s like a doctor with a poor bedside manner: he isn&#8217;t especially interested in dressing things up but for the good of his patient he tells it like it is.  Still, as I journey through the book of Ezekiel, I find plenty of sunshine along with his gruffness.  At one point he tells people that they can&#8217;t rely on past goodness to cover current sin.  If even the most pious person turns from God&#8217;s ways to sin he or she will be judged not for their past, but their current life.  However, there&#8217;s good news in flip side of that situation.  If a person who&#8217;s living a sinful life hears Ezekiel&#8217;s hard message and decides to pay attention and straighten up there&#8217;s a real possibility of life.  God will gladly give that individual a second chance.  Now that&#8217;s a message for any day.  The Lord loves it when sinners turn to him.  He doesn&#8217;t hold our past against us and is more than willing to forgive sins and transform lives.  That&#8217;s good news for every one of us who has made bad choices and wishes life had a rewind button.  We can&#8217;t go back but by God&#8217;s grace we can go forward.  If a person turns to God, Ezekiel tells us, &#8220;He&#8217;ll live.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: We can&#8217;t go back but by the grace of the Lord we can go forward.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good news for people who need a Second Chance Ezekiel 33: None of his sins will be kept on the books.
