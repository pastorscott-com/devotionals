Isaac, frail and blind, is basically interested in being taken care of. Rebekah is a conniving, manipulative wife. Esau, well, he\u2019s not the sharpest knife in the drawer and Jacob is, as his name suggests, \u201ca heel.\u201d Here my friend is a family in dire need of counseling! Isaac, who will live for years longer, is convinced he\u2019s dying and needs to pass the promise given to his father, Abraham, on to his son. However, he can\u2019t imagine blessing anyone without his having a full belly. Rebekah hears her husband\u2019s intention and goes to work to secure the blessing for her favorite, Jacob. Again, this is a messed up family! For the people of ancient Israel, hearing this story must have been a letdown. After all, these are their ancestors: their heroes of their faith. Abraham had his share of blunders, but, ultimately, he comes out looking good. Isaac, his son, ends up with a family that would be at home in a modern sitcom. However, there\u2019s one redeeming feature to all this. You see, the story isn\u2019t really about the tragic comedy of Isaac and family. Instead, it\u2019s about God. Their pitiful story is redeemed by the Redeemer. The Lord has made promises to this family and he intends to keep those promises. The Lord&#8217;s always gracious and while their situation may not be very pretty it does serve to highlight the brightness of God\u2019s grace.<br \/>\nTake away: I\u2019m thankful that the Lord works through the comedy of my life in redeeming ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One messed up family Genesis 27: Fix me a hearty meal so that I can&#8230;bless you.
