He makes the decision to run to God, making him Lord of his life and when he does this all the puzzle pieces of his life fall into place.  Because of his trust in God he\u2019s drawn to the best friends he could ever have.  As he chooses the Lord he\u2019s pleasantly surprised that before he ever picked God that God picked him!  Now, day and night, his life confirms his decision and, when the end comes, he knows that his decision to serve the Lord will go with him into the world to come.  It sounds almost too good to be true.  Know what?  It is true: every word of it.  It\u2019s no wonder David has a smile on his face!  I guess that&#8217;s the reason Christians are so joyful too.  After all, our story is every bit as victorious as is David&#8217;s.  In fact, we know more about it than he does.   We have (in Paul Harvey&#8217;s words) &#8220;the rest of the story.&#8221;  We know about the Incarnation, the cross, and the resurrection.  What&#8217;s that?  You don&#8217;t think Christians are all that joyful?  Well, shame on them&#8230;on us&#8230;on me!<br \/>\nTake Away: The people of the Lord have every reason to rejoice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No wonder we\u2019re so happy!
