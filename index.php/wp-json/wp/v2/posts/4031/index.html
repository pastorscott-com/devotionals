He speaks and things happen. There\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s in charge and the account of Creation is all about what the Creator does. On the other hand, there\u2019s no more effort made to tell me \u201chow\u201d it happened than there is to explain God, himself. If I want to know the composition of light, I\u2019ll have to look elsewhere because the Bible doesn\u2019t tell me. If this is a poetic description of a \u201cbig bang\u201d it\u2019s okay with me so long as I can believe that God is the one who creates and directs the energy of it in the first place. So, as I read these opening pages of the Bible, I immediately encounter the \u201cWho\u201d of it all and I immediately find that this Creator isn\u2019t all that interested in satisfying my curiosity of \u201chow.\u201d However, there is one thing he wants me to know: that\u2019s \u201cwhat\u201d he has done. He declares to me that it\u2019s \u201cvery good.\u201d I know \u201cWho\u201d did it but I don\u2019t know \u201chow\u201d he did it. Still, I know that \u201cwhat\u201d he did is \u201cso good!\u201d As I read this account I\u2019d better concentrate more on what I\u2019m supposed to know and less on what the Lord doesn\u2019t bother to tell me about it.<br \/>\nTake away: I need to focus on the Creator and not get too wound up in how he created.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Who, How, and What of Creation Genesis 1: It was so good, so very good!
