Some folks get all wrapped up in proving that Job is a historical figure but that doesn&#8217;t matter very much either. As they say, &#8220;there are bigger fish to fry&#8221; here. While I lean toward the \u201chistorical\u201d side of the debate, I\u2019m much more interested in learning the God-lessons that are taught here than I am in the silly \u201cJob has to be real or the whole Bible\u2019s not true\u201d debate. Here\u2019s a story about suffering; and not just suffering in general, but undeserved suffering. Job doesn&#8217;t suffer quietly and he doesn&#8217;t just go along with the conventional wisdom of his friends. He complains persistently and loudly: to God! If I spend my time debating the location of Ur or whether or not Satan has face to face consultations with God I miss the whole point of this story. If I\u2019m willing to just let the story be told without my attaching some personal agenda to it, I find myself in some pretty challenging material, dealing with big issues of undeserved suffering and life and death.<br \/>\nTake Away: Every story in the Bible is, ultimately a God-story. To make a story into something else will cause us to miss the point.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Where on earth is Uz? Job 1: Job was a man who lived in Uz.
