An old friend comes to the leader, Joshua, with an insistent request.  Caleb was a mature 40 years old when he was named one of the 12 to scout out the Promised Land.  Now of the 12, only he and Joshua are left, with Caleb at 85 years of age.  All of his contemporaries are dead and he&#8217;s in the twilight of life.   But he doesn&#8217;t come to Joshua to reminisce about the good old days.  A generation ago, when the people were revolting against God this man stood firmly for God.  The Lord was pleased with Caleb and promised that a portion of Canaan would be his.  Now, Caleb is reminding Joshua of that.  For over 40 years Caleb has remembered that land and now he wants it as his inheritance.  The thing is this section of Canaan is still unconquered.  In fact, there\u2019s a fortress there.  What is an 85-year-old man going to do in the face of such opposition?  Caleb says, &#8220;Just give it to me and see what I am going to do!&#8221;  You have to like old Caleb!  This guy trusts God to keep his word, and not just in some vague theoretical sense.  He trusts God in a blood and dirt, &#8220;let&#8217;s get to it&#8221; kind of way.  Tell you what, I want to be more like that &#8212; more ready to take God at his word and start claiming that which he&#8217;s promised me.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord can do amazing things through a person who takes him at his word.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What can an old man do?
