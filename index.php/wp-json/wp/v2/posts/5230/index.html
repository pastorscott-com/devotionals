Unless I learn humility I spend my life, not necessarily thinking I\u2019m better than others, but thinking that everything that happens should happen the way I want it to.  For me to be humble is for me to realize that I\u2019m not the center of the universe and that the world has no obligation to please me.  Beyond that, to be humble is for me to come to the realization the most satisfying life is not all about my getting my own way about things, but is, instead, found as I live with others in mind.  Jesus said that I\u2019m to &#8220;love my neighbor as myself.&#8221;  The result of such a life, according to the wise man of the Proverbs, is &#8220;glory.&#8221;  That is, others will be irresistibly drawn to me and my life will influence them in positive ways.  Not only that, but God will be pleased with me for patterning my life after that of his own Son who humbly lived and died for others.  This proverb reminds me that the route to glory isn\u2019t by my taking power and trying to shape the world to suit me.  Instead, it\u2019s achieved by loving others and placing their needs at a level equal to my own.<br \/>\nTake Away: Contrary to what we may think, humble people are some of the most influential people there are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning humility Proverbs 15: First you learn humility, then you experience glory.
