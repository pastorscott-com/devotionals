It\u2019s not \u201chere and there\u201d or \u201cthem and us.\u201d  The glorious plan and possibility is that in Christ everything comes together.  This great Unifier works through and with a specific group of people who have made him Lord of their lives.  That group, we\u2019re told, is the Church.  Obviously, Paul\u2019s not talking about a denomination here and he\u2019s certainly not thinking of some local body of believers.  This is the \u201ccapitol-C\u201d Church.  It\u2019s through this body, \u201chis body,\u201d that Jesus is bringing everything together.  As I look at the Church today, it\u2019s a mistake for me to only focus on its failings.  Jesus sees the Church as his body and as the hope of the world.  Even as I acknowledge its failures, I\u2019d better remember its purpose and the source of its power and authority in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: God has chosen to work through the Church to bring salvation to the world.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Church: Christ at work in the world Ephesians 1: The church, you see, is not peripheral to the world, the world is peripheral to the church.
