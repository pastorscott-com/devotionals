Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I know it\u2019s important to pray for the lost while thanking the Lord that I\u2019ve been found.  Still, there\u2019s a place for cooperate confession.  Our culture is rotten.  Immorality is the norm.  These are &#8220;our&#8221; sins.  Lord, we know we&#8217;re guilty, we&#8217;re bad people.  Please do something to help us, do it for your sake.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s something powerful and life changing in praying prayers of cooperate confession.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are sinners Jeremiah 14: We know we&#8217;re guilty.
