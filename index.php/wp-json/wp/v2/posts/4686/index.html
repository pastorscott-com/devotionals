He\u2019s already built palaces, cataloged information about plants and animals, and amassed an impressive and well-equipped army. His reputation has spread across the face of the earth and he\u2019s forged alliances with other nations. Now, he turns his attention to the building of the Temple. You might say that everything else he\u2019s done has been practice for this, his most memorable accomplishment. As construction gets underway Solomon hears a word from the Lord. He\u2019s reminded that living in daily obedience to God is even more important than constructing buildings to the glory of God. For Solomon, and for all those who call on the Name of the Lord, this is a vital concept. It\u2019s so easy to confuse the things we do for the Lord with being in a right relationship with the Lord. More than sacrifices, more than building projects, more than well-organized church programs God desires that I concentrate on having a genuine connection to himself. All the rest is to flow out of that relationship. It\u2019s a vital matter of priorities and, as it\u2019s important in this passage for Solomon it\u2019s important for me.<br \/>\nTake Away: We must be careful we don\u2019t confuse the things we do in the Name of the Lord with our living in a genuine relationship with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keeping first things first 1Kings 5: What&#8217;s important is that you live the way I&#8217;ve set out for you and do what I tell you.
