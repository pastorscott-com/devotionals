One basket has good fruit and the other has bad fruit.  The Lord tells Jeremiah that the good figs represent people who\u2019ll obey God&#8217;s call to surrender to the Babylonians and be relocated to other lands by them.  The bad figs represent the leaders and others who are ignoring God&#8217;s demand that they surrender and accept the Lord&#8217;s judgment on the nation.  Even the &#8220;good fig&#8221; population, though, is in need of a divine heart transplant.  God says he&#8217;s going to do just that.  Those who trust and obey him, placing their lives in his hands, aren&#8217;t considered complete until the Lord makes some basic changes in their hearts.  I think this illustrates the work of the Lord in our individual lives.  On one hand, I surrender my life to the Lord, committing myself to live for him, no matter what might come.  On the other hand, God does in me what I can&#8217;t do for myself.  He changes my very heart, enabling me to love him with all my being.  It is then, Jeremiah tells me, that I&#8217;m one of God&#8217;s people, and he is Lord of my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord does in me what I can&#8217;t do for myself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Heart transplant Jeremiah 24: I\u2019ll give them a heart to know me, God.
