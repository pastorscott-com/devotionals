People are more reverent concerning spiritual things and the worship of the Lord God has become more and more common. Now, through the ministry of God&#8217;s man, Samuel, they\u2019ve arrived at a crossroads. It\u2019s time for a clean break with the gods of Canaan and to surrender to the true God. They\u2019ve come a long way during these 20 years but it\u2019s now time to close the deal. It\u2019s time to decide. It\u2019s time to commit. Their response is a powerful three-word sentence: &#8220;They did it.&#8221; Reading these words reminds me of watching the eastern horizon at the dawning of a new day. The sky slowly becomes brighter, a hint of things to come. Then, with dazzling beauty, the sun slips into view, flooding the earth with the light of a new day. In the book of 1 Samuel we can watch the process with spiritual eyes. A childless woman prays and a son is given. The boy hears the Voice of God calling him in the night. The adventures of the Ark of God begin to transform the thinking of the people. Samuel inaugurates his ministry by calling for a decision. &#8220;They did it.&#8221; A new day dawns for Israel! Spiritual awakenings call for decision and commitment.<br \/>\nTake Away: God moves, but he doesn\u2019t force us to respond.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sunrise! 1 Samuel 7: If you are truly serious about coming back to God, clean house\u2026they did it.
