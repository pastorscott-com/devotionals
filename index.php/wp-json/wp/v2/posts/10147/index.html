He doesn\u2019t suggest to them that suffering in itself is good but he does tell them that their suffering for the right reason gives them reason to rejoice. If the same people who hate Jesus hate us because they see Jesus in our lives their poor treatment of us may be unwelcome but in it we can see a compliment. He also tells his readers that suffering tends to wean us from the idea that we&#8217;re always supposed to get our own way. As infants, we all start off there, caring not at all about the needs of those around us, but instead, totally focused on what we want and having it right now. To some extent we never outgrow that. Peter says that suffering (something no one wants) helps break that \u201cme centered\u201d way of life. This, in turn, sets the table for allowing the One who knows and loves us best to have his way in our lives. Again, the suffering isn\u2019t a good thing, but the result can be a good one. My earnest desire is that I\u2019ll learn these lessons early and well as the Lord uses the ups and downs of my life to benefit me and his kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: If we\u2019ll allow it the Lord will use both the ups and downs of our lives to our benefit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Breaking the \u201cme centered\u201d way of life 1Peter 4: Think of your sufferings as a weaning from that old sinful habit of always expecting to get your own way.
