Their forbearers left Egypt by passing through the Red Sea. They were fleeing slavery and the Egyptian army that was bent on their destruction.  Crossing the Red Sea was a &#8220;do or die&#8221; event for them.  Then, their parents had been on the banks of the Jordan just a generation earlier.  Their decision was not based on what was behind them, but on what was before them.  They rebelled against God and refused to cross the river.  You might want to say that in their eyes it was a &#8220;don&#8217;t or die&#8221; situation.  Now, forty years later it\u2019s their children and grandchildren\u2019s moment of decision.  What a glorious sight: hundreds of thousands of Abraham\u2019s descendants moving forward in faith.  The Lord has promised them possession of the land on the other side of the river and they&#8217;ve chosen to believe that God keeps his promises.  This crossing of the Jordan is a declaration of war on all those who occupy that land.  While their grandparents and parents retreated to avoid battle these people are marching, not away from, but in to battle.  Why?  They trust God.  That\u2019s the whole difference.  People who doubt God shrink back and go it alone.  People who trust the Lord move forward even if it means facing some giants along the way.  As I read this account the word that comes to mind is \u201ctrust.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: Trust advances, doubt retreats.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trust Joshua 3: Finally the whole nation was across the Jordan, and not one wet foot.
