In fact, I think the Lord has provided physical healing for me.  I also believe it is okay to read the Scriptures devotionally.  That is, while I think I need to be careful about the context and intent of Scripture when studying, preaching, and teaching that it\u2019s okay for me to read something and draw a more personal meaning out of it.  I need to be careful when I do that because I can end up a long distance from where a passage is supposed to take me, but it can also be to my benefit to more freely explore the Word from a devotional point of view.  That brings me to this passage.  Isaiah is describing the Suffering Servant who will be Jesus.  Specifically, he\u2019s talking about how he\u2019ll be abused for our sins.  In poetic form he describes that abuse and how it will benefit us.  The entire passage is about our salvation: Jesus is beaten to the point of disfigurement, ripped and torn and crushed and bruised for our salvation.  When I get to the line about his being bruised for my healing I know that Isaiah hasn&#8217;t suddenly changed the subject from Christ suffering to save our souls to his suffering that I might be healed of my health problems.  The &#8220;healing&#8221; he\u2019s talking about is a healing of my broken relationship with God, not healing from cancer or heart problems or diabetes.  With all that in mind, I need to remember to read this passage in light of what Isaiah is actually talking about and not want I want him to be talking about.  Devotionally, I can connect this to passages like that in the Book of James in which we\u2019re given instructions about praying for the healing of the sick.  Realistically, though, I need to be honest in acknowledging that this passage doesn&#8217;t teach that Christ&#8217;s suffering was so I could be healed of physical infirmities.<br \/>\nTake Away: Christ suffered that our relationship with the Lord, broken by our sin, might be healed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being honest as I read God\u2019s Word Isaiah 53: Through his bruises we get healed.
