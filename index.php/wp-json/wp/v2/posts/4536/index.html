Not long ago the old man of God, Samuel, floored him with the announcement that he has been picked by God to be the first king of Israel. Then there\u2019s the surprising episode with the prophets; he still hasn&#8217;t figured that one out. Now, he finds himself at the big gathering to announce the new king. He already knows the outcome; Samuel let him in on God&#8217;s plan and the prospect of being king both terrifies and thrills him. This big man dislikes being noticed &#8212; something that can hardly be avoided. After all, just his standing up gets him plenty of attention. Almost by instinct he slips out of the main gathering to find a comfortable, out of sight place among the baggage. Here he sits, wondering what he will do when his name is announced. The answer to the question is known soon enough: he does nothing. Frozen in fear and indecision he sits there until someone finds him. Like it or not, he is the man picked by God to be king and the Lord won&#8217;t take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer. I feel kind of sorry for Saul in this incident. In fact, I identify with both his hesitation and thrill at what the Lord\u2019s doing in his life. Often I find myself feeling unworthy and incapable of doing what the Lord places before me. The greatest source of hope in such times is the knowledge that when God calls to some task he also provides the strength necessary to accomplish that task. Still, it would sometimes be easier to hide among the baggage.<br \/>\nTake Away: If the Lord calls you to it, he\u2019ll enable you to do it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Luggage compartment 1 Samuel 10: He&#8217;s right over there &#8212; hidden in that pile of baggage.
