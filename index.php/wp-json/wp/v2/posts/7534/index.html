He can humbly respond to the Lord&#8217;s overtures to him or not.  In the terms of tennis, he &#8220;whiffs it.&#8221;  That is, he totally bungles the opportunity he&#8217;s given.  At the beginning he was ignorant concerning the God Daniel worshiped and could be cut some slack when he didn&#8217;t get it.  Now, he&#8217;s not only seen what this God can do but he&#8217;s also heard from him personally; not once, but twice.  It&#8217;s time for him to respond.  Instead, he chooses to tip his hat to the Lord and then continue as he always has.  As Nebuchadnezzar congratulates himself for all &#8220;he&#8221; has done the Lord moves on his life in one last act of mercy: the Lord grants to him a mental breakdown!  I know it doesn&#8217;t sound much like mercy.  Rather, it seems more like judgment.  However, if dreams and miracles can&#8217;t get this stubborn man\u2019s attention the Lord has only two choices: destroy him or humble him.  It&#8217;s in mercy that the Lord humbles Nebuchadnezzar.  Here\u2019s more evidence that God wants to redeem the lost.  Human wisdom might dictate giving up and moving on to the next candidate.  God says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s give it one more try; this time, maybe some strong medicine will do the trick.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t think God routinely causes mental breakdowns, but I do think he goes to extreme measures in granting mercy to us.  He is, indeed, the God of &#8220;Second Chances.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord goes to extreme measures in granting mercy to us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God working in the extreme Daniel 4: The High God rules human kingdoms and puts whomever he wishes in charge.
