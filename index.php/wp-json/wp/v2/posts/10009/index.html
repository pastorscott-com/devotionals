Here we are, still in that first Easter and Jesus arrives inside a locked room where the disciples are gathered.  On his agenda is this \u201cbreathing into them\u201d event.  He connects it to their receiving the Holy Spirit, using the word that we translate \u201cbreath\u201d or \u201cSpirit\u201d to describe the event.  In this they\u2019re being invited breathe the breath of God.  This is obviously related to the opening pages of our Bibles in which the Lord God makes human beings and then breathes into them the breath of life.  Now, following the resurrection, Jesus symbolically breaths into his disciples the spiritual Breath of Life, the Holy Spirit.  As we know, in the not too distant future, the disciples, likely in this same room, will be filled with \u201cHoly Breath\u201d as the Spirit dramatically comes upon them.  One of the results of the resurrection is the potential of God\u2019s people being filled with the new spiritual empowerment of \u201cHoly Breath.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: \u201cBreathe on me, Breath of God.\u201d<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Holy Breath John 20: He took a deep breath and breathed into them.
