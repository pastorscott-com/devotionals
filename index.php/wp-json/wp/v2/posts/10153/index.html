He tells his readers that he\u2019s writing \u201cto guide you out of sin.\u201d Then, if a believer falls back into sin, he points us to the remedy, our \u201cPriest-Friend\u201d Jesus. Beyond that, as I consider the broader problem of sin, I\u2019m told that Jesus has already dealt with sin at that level too. Sin, which breaks our relationship with our Heavenly Father, has been decisively dealt with through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. \u201cHe solved the sin problem for good.\u201d When sin is an issue in my life there\u2019s a remedy and his name is Jesus. From this passage I learn, then, that Christians can live in victory over intentional spiritual failure. I learn that if that failure comes anyway that Christ\u2019s victory can yet be mine. I learn that, even as I\u2019m dismayed by rampant, destructive sin in the world that there\u2019s hope, a way out through the Lord. Because of him I\u2019m set free from the domination of sin. That opens the way to abundant life. For every person who struggles with some old sinful habit; for everyone who sometimes feels the tug of some especially powerful temptation; for everyone who wants to live freely in Christ \u2013 for everyone \u2013 this is a wonderful, hope-filled Word from the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: At the cross Jesus defeated sin and death once and for all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Victory in Jesus 1John 2: He solved the sin problem for good.
