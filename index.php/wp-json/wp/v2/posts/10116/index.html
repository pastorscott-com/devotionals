Paul instructs Timothy, first of all, to differentiate between younger widows, widows with family, and, what he calls \u201clegitimate widows.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s best for younger widows to marry and get on with life. Families of widows are to take care of their own and not expect the church to do their job for them. However, the destitute widow, without means or family, is the responsibility of the church. Again, I need to look for principles here and not get mired down in specifics. For instance, family responsibility trumps church responsibility. Also, if my need can be handled through \u201cmore conventional\u201d means, I\u2019m to follow that route first. The church, I understand, has responsibilities to care for its people but it\u2019s not to be the first solution. Paul gives Timothy a written policy to be followed here. If it\u2019s followed, the energies and resources of the church won\u2019t be hijacked by concerns that are best addressed elsewhere. On one hand, then, I have a fairly straightforward principle here. On the other hand, I have to admit that the practical application is quite challenging.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The church has a role to play in social issues, but it generally isn\u2019t the primary support organization.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The social ministry of the church 1Timothy 5: Take care of widows who are destitute.
