However, what&#8217;s about to happen is intended to form these newly freed slaves into a people of God.  They\u2019re camped at the foot of Sinai and the Lord is stating his plan for them.  If they\u2019ll listen obediently to his words they\u2019ll be a unique people on the face of the earth: a kingdom of priests who enjoy the blessings of the Almighty.  The elders of Israel immediately respond that \u201ceverything God says, we will do.\u201d  I know that I\u2019m standing at the beginning of what will be a long, failure-filled journey.  They won\u2019t even break camp at Sinai before there\u2019s a massive spiritual failure.  Still, if I stop looking ahead and simply consider this exchange, I\u2019m impressed by what I see.  First, The Lord&#8217;s making the wonderful, amazing promise of connecting their lives to his.  They don\u2019t deserve it but in an amazing act of grace the offer is made.  Second, they say \u201cyes.\u201d  Again, I know that many failures are coming, but in this time and place, when God offers them this unlikely partnership, they respond with just the right answer.  In spite of the fact that I know things aren\u2019t going to always work out as they should I also remember here that had they said, \u201cNo\u201d the story would end here and now.  In saying \u201cyes\u201d to God they open the door to an unprecedented relationship with him.  To some extent, all human beings receive this same offer from the Lord.  We can respond that we\u2019re not worthy or that it\u2019s too hard or that we\u2019re likely to fail.  Know what?  He already knows all that.  Still, the offer is there.  When the Lord calls my name, I can respond no better than these ancient Israelites did: \u201cEverything God says, we will do.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: I can\u2019t do better than saying the \u201cbig yes\u201d to the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What an offer Exodus 19: Everything God says, we will do.
