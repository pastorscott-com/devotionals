When the Israelites get into a difficult battle they think that bringing out the Ark of the Covenant will bring them luck. However, it doesn&#8217;t work out that way. They\u2019re soundly defeated and their enemies take the Ark, their most holy relic. Now, the story shifts to the Philistine city of Ashdod, the shrine of the idol Dagon. Someone has the bright idea of putting their new religious prize on display there with their idol. After a bit of rearranging the Ark is in its new place. To their surprise, when they visit the shrine the next morning their Dagon idol has toppled face down before the Ark. &#8220;I wonder how that happened?&#8221; someone asks in an unsteady voice. Dagon is stood up again. The following morning the priest of Dagon peeks around the corner and it\u2019s happened again! This time, though, poor old Dagon&#8217;s in bad shape. His head and arms are broken off and he\u2019s once again bowing before the Ark. Something has to be done and the decision is made, not to start worshipping the God of the Ark, but to get rid of it so that they can patch up poor old Dagon and prop him up back in his place again. It sounds dumb and in a sense it is. Still, they believe in national gods and the God of Israel, in their thinking, can never be theirs. The Chest has to go. As I read this interesting account I\u2019m reminded that everything in my life must ultimately yield to God Almighty. Also, God isn&#8217;t a good luck charm. He\u2019s the real deal and he insists that I live in a relationship with him.<br \/>\nTake Away: Ultimately everything in my life must bow before the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poor old Dagon didn\u2019t have a chance 1 Samuel 5: They were shocked to find Dagon toppled from his place, flat on his face before the Chest of God.
