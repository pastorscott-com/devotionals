Later on, the Revelator will remember these words when the Lord describes to him what\u2019s coming at the end of time.  In fact, some think that Isaiah is having a vision of the same thing John sees in Revelation.  However, left in context Isaiah\u2019s describing the end of the exile of his people; the return to their beloved Jerusalem.  The language is that of poetry: God\u2019s doing something new and is, therefore changing everything.  Life\u2019s going to be much better than it has been.  Wonderful blessings are in store.  I think this is another dual prophecy.  Isaiah\u2019s speaking to current events, describing things in a big way but unaware that his words will literally come true in his (and our) distant future.  If I leave things there, I still find the transformational language of Isaiah quite interesting.  The Lord is bringing salvation to his people and as a result, everything\u2019s going to change for the better.  However, at an entirely different level than Isaiah speaking to his contemporaries or John writing about the New Jerusalem I find myself thinking of the change Christ makes when he bring salvation to an individual&#8217;s life.  When I\u2019m forgiven of my sins and become a child of God &#8220;all things become new.&#8221;  If Isaiah&#8217;s view of the restoration of Israel brings to mind visions of &#8220;new heavens and a new earth&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that it\u2019s off base to find a parallel to the radical transformation being &#8220;born again&#8221; brings to each life.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord doesn\u2019t just forgive us our sins \u2013 he also goes to work in us, transforming our lives, remaking us in wonderful ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God doing something new Isaiah 65: I&#8217;m creating new heavens and a new earth.
