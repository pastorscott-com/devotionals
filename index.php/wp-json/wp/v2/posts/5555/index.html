However, her desire to &#8220;do it herself&#8221; could never be fixed by her taking a pill.  It&#8217;s a part of the human condition.  Specifically, it\u2019s what we say to our Creator.  We\u2019re made to live in fellowship with the Lord, to be partners with him in his purposes in our world.  Instead, we turn our backs on God, insisting &#8220;I&#8217;d rather do it myself.&#8221;  The result is, well, it&#8217;s what I see on the evening news every day.  Pain and suffering, hating and killing: it&#8217;s all the result of our doing it ourselves.  The fact is that as long as we make the most basic of mistakes: the exclusion of God from our lives, everything else is just putting band aids on life-threatening wounds.  On the largest scale, the only hope of humanity is surrender to God.  On the personal scale, it\u2019s the same.  Jeremiah says, &#8220;Men and women don&#8217;t have what it takes to take charge of life.&#8221;  His solution is to do what God designed us to do in the first place: connect to God and let him be Lord of all that we are.<br \/>\nTake Away: We\u2019re designed to live in fellowship with the Lord and nothing else will do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Letting God be Lord Jeremiah 10: Mere mortals can&#8217;t run their own lives.
