The Lord will breathe life back into their dry bones and the nation will be brought back from the destruction that has come.  It&#8217;s at this point that Ezekiel turns his attention to the &#8220;distant future&#8221; and the mysterious &#8220;Gog and Magog.&#8221;  From what I can tell, the more down to earth commentators think that Ezekiel&#8217;s original audience knew just who he was talking about and that this prophecy is much like those given against Egypt, Tyre, Sidon, and other nations in the region.  Taken at face value, then, Ezekiel is prophesying that in a more distant future, after the restoration of Israel, another regional power will come against God&#8217;s people.  When that happens, the Lord will move to defend them and will destroy the invaders.  However, there are two things that get the attention of many.  First, this nation from &#8220;the north&#8221; isn&#8217;t clearly identified in history.  Second, &#8220;Magog&#8221; is mentioned in a similarly vague way in Genesis and then Gog and Magog make a major appearance in the book of Revelation as part of the wind up of history.  If we conclude that the &#8220;distant future&#8221; Ezekiel&#8217;s talking about is still in our future we find ourselves swimming in the deeper waters of prophecy.  I hate to disappoint you, but I&#8217;m not ready to go there.  I think it&#8217;s more likely that Ezekiel is talking about a nation well known to him and his listeners and that the distant future isn&#8217;t &#8220;book of Revelation distant.&#8221;  I think that when John writes Revelation he&#8217;s reminded of Ezekiel&#8217;s words: an attack on God&#8217;s people by a coalition of enemy forces.  He uses that reference to describe the scene of the final battle.  To me, the key to the whole passage is God&#8217;s promise to defend his people and to &#8220;demonstrate his holiness&#8221; to the world.  That concept plugs into both the Ezekiel and the Revelation prophecies.  It also plugs into my life: when everything seems to be against me the Lord knows how to rescue me as one of his people.  Rather than getting all mystic about this passage, I&#8217;d rather find here yet another promise of God&#8217;s faithfulness even in the most difficult of circumstances.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even when it seems everything is falling apart God is still God and God is always faithful to those who trust in him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gog and Magog Ezekiel 39: I&#8217;ll use them to demonstrate my holiness with all the nations watching.
