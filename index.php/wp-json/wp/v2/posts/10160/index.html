To some extent I think its John\u2019s own fault. He likes to write using symbols and poetry. Also in play, I think, are the advances of technology John never imagined. He writes this letter thinking it\u2019ll be passed around among seven churches. He never imagines that 1500 years later an invention will allow his letter to be mass produced and put in the hands of anyone who wants to read it. Had he thought about people greatly removed from the seven churches reading and trying to understand his words he might have at least added a few footnotes for those of us reading his writing hundreds of years later and under vastly different circumstances. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s nothing here for us today. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. John\u2019s Revelation connects us to Jesus in a way very different than do the Gospels or the Epistles. Here, we get a glimpse of how things look when viewed from heaven\u2019s side. As long as I remember the purpose of this book \u2013 that it\u2019s a revelation of Jesus &#8212; it has great value to me. Also, let me remind you that I\u2019m writing devotionally here so don\u2019t expect me to find any secret messages or unique interpretations here.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: When reading any book of the Bible it\u2019s important to understand its purpose and read it with that purpose in mind.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The book of the Bible that promises to make things plain to us Revelation 1: A revealing of Jesus, the Messiah.
