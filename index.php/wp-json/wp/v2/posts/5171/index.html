The goal of this, what we would think of as a &#8220;praise chorus&#8221; psalm, is to praise God for being God.  No doubt, there are many things the Lord has done for me that should inspire me to praise but once in a while it\u2019s good to remember that God is worthy simply because of Who He is.  Strictly speaking, then, there\u2019s never a time when praise is out of order.  I say that carefully because I know that my humanity and the events of my life can break the spontaneity of praise.  After all, I\u2019m also told to &#8220;weep with those who weep.&#8221;  Still this psalm reminds me that no matter what winds are blowing in my life that God is still God and as God he\u2019s worthy of praise.  He\u2019s my Maker and my Good Shepherd.  His love and beauty, his faithfulness and grace never cease.  So why not?  Let&#8217;s sing a song of praise!<br \/>\nTake Away: If it\u2019s okay to cry out to the Lord when things are not going our way, it\u2019s also okay to remember that even in the midst of that trial that God is still God and worthy of our praise.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praise the Lord!
