It isn&#8217;t true.  The Lord created us for fellowship with himself.  From the beginning he walked with Adam in the cool of the day.  I don&#8217;t have to do some extreme thing to hear from God.  All I have to do is listen.  But that&#8217;s a problem isn&#8217;t it?  Hearing the Voice of God in the ordinary flow of life takes practice.  If I want to hear him speak when I\u2019m sitting in the emergency room of a hospital or when a precious friend is pouring his heart out to me seeking spiritual council I have to practice listening for him when I\u2019m not in the pressure cooker of life.  I&#8217;m certain that God speaks, and that he does so constantly.  Sadly, I am also sure that I\u2019m not a very good listener.  For this proverb to work for me; for me to listen for God&#8217;s voice everywhere I go, I need to practice the presence of God every day.  The way to accomplish that is for me to discipline myself to meet God by creating quiet places in life where I can learn to hear his Voice.  Then, when I&#8217;m out there in the &#8220;everywhere you go&#8221; part of life, I will have trained my spiritual ear to recognize the Master&#8217;s Voice.<br \/>\nTake Away: It takes practice to learn to hear the Voice of God in the noisy situations of life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning to listen Proverbs 3: Listen for God&#8217;s voice in everything you do, everywhere you go.
