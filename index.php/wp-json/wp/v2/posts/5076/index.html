Job doesn&#8217;t really disagree with what his friends believe; he just sees himself as an innocent victim of some cosmic mistake.  Bildad&#8217;s comment that &#8220;God doesn&#8217;t mess up&#8221; is at the heart of all this.  Job and his friends believe that when a person has something bad happen to them that it\u2019s because they\u2019re being punished by God.  Bildad doesn&#8217;t need any other evidence of Job&#8217;s children&#8217;s sin than the fact that they all died in a tornado.  Since he can&#8217;t imagine a horrible thing like that &#8220;just happening&#8221; it has to be that God did it.  And, if God did it, he did it for a reason.  After all, everyone knows God doesn&#8217;t make mistakes.  As I\u2019ve said, the purpose of this book to answer the question, &#8220;Will a man serve God for nothing?&#8221;  However, there are other issues in play and the majority of the book is taken up with those issues.  This is one of the big ones: how does the reality of bad things happening to good people fit a theology of a wise, loving, and all knowing God?<br \/>\nTake Away: One result of reading this book of the Bible is that the reader has to think about big issues.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Caution: big issues in play Job 8: Does God mess up?
