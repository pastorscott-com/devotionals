During Sinai I, while the people rebelled Moses was on the mountain having an awesome encounter with God.  Seeing that the people rebelled against God and his ways before they could even get started Moses broke the tablets containing the Law.  However, Moses still intercedes for them and God graciously gives them another chance.  In fact, God is willing to reveal himself to Moses in even a more personal way than he did out in the desert in the burning bush or when he came to Sinai the first time.  It\u2019s during this indescribable encounter that the words that arrest our attention today are stated.  Old Moses can hardly contain himself as he proclaims God\u2019s mercy, grace, and patience.  Nope!  This isn\u2019t Moses speaking.  Instead, it\u2019s God!   So what\u2019s going on here?  I think I know.  As the Almighty begins to create a people and works specifically with the man he\u2019s chosen to lead them, he\u2019s giving Moses a lesson in worship.  And Moses gets it!  He falls on his face before God.  Maybe I need some worship lessons too.  I\u2019m glad the Lord is a willing Teacher.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank God for Second Chances and thank him also for being such a patient teacher.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worship Lessons Exodus 34: God, God a God of mercy and grace, endlessly patient \u2013 so much love, so deeply true \u2013 loyal in love for a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin.
