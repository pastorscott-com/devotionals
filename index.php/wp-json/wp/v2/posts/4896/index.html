An impressive Temple is now the official place of worship for the people of Israel and all others who will come. The building is complete with the fixtures in place, the offerings ready, and the personnel standing ready to serve. Then God moves in. In a display of glory that hasn\u2019t been seen since Moses climbed the mountain to meet the Almighty, the Glory of the Lord fills the Temple. The Presence of the Lord is so great, so real, that the priests can\u2019t even carry out their assigned duties. Outside the Temple Solomon does the only reasonable thing: he begins to call on God in prayer. Today, I long for God\u2019s glory to fall on his Church, for Him to come in such majesty that the order of worship is set aside and people begin to simply call on the Name of the Lord. Oh God, we seek, not so much the \u201cbillowing cloud\u201d as we seek you. Pour yourself out upon your Church as you did upon the Temple so long ago.<br \/>\nTake Away: The people of the Lord need to seek and, yes, expect, the Lord to fill our worship services with himself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I love it when God moves in 2 Chronicles 5: Then a billowing cloud filled The Temple of God.
