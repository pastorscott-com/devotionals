God had judged Ahab&#8217;s sin years earlier, and even though he has, at times, blessed Israel with his help against her enemies, the Lord never overlooks what Ahab has continued doing. At the right time the Lord raises up Jehu to act in judgment on Ahab&#8217;s family. It\u2019s bloody but it\u2019s intended to give Israel a chance to return to the path that they left so long ago. Before Jehu&#8217;s finished Ahab&#8217;s family is destroyed and the altars of Baal are gone. In spite of all that, Jehu&#8217;s a disappointment. I see here that the Lord uses less than perfect vessels to accomplish his purposes. Also I\u2019m reminded that no one has to fail. Jehu let a golden opportunity slip through his fingers.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord works in and through imperfect people to carry out his plans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Missed opportunity 2Kings 10: God doing what, through Elijah, he said he&#8217;d do.
