In the specific case of this passage there\u2019s considerable pressure on them to follow the general population in worship of the Beast. These saints resist and at personal cost persist in being \u201cfaithful to Jesus.\u201d Now, for them, the battle ends. Their \u201chard, hard work\u201d is over and \u201cGod blesses them for it all in the end.\u201d I\u2019ve known people such as these described in this passage. They loved the Lord and served him through their lives. When hard times came, they wished for a way out, but way out or not, they continued to trust God. Physically, they were ultimately defeated. Spiritually though, they were victorious. John is told to remind God\u2019s people that those who \u201cdie in the Master\u201d are blessed. Unless Jesus comes back first, my turn&#8217;s coming. I want the same kind of passionate patience, the same faithfulness to God\u2019s commands, to be the hallmark of my life.
