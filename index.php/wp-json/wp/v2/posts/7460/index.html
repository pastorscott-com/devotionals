Ezekiel says that just as a world power of previous generations, Assyria, fell like a big tree so will Egypt.  This is a double edged prophecy because Israel has looked to their previous enslavers for help against Babylon.  Therefore, the prophecy is not only directed to Egypt but to Israel as well.  The nation Israel turns to (rather than turning to God in repentance) will shatter before them.  Ezekiel calls the Pharaoh a &#8220;pompous old goat,&#8221; acting as though he&#8217;s important and powerful but is, in reality, reigning over a dying, powerless country that won&#8217;t be able to protect itself much less protect Israel.  My devotional thought from all of this is a simple one.  I need to be careful that I don&#8217;t lean on a &#8220;splintered reed&#8221; in my life either.  My hope isn\u2019t in the U.S. economy or some political figure or in anything else.  I hope for better things for this nation, but I know that all these &#8220;securities&#8221; can all come crashing down at any time.  Christ is my hope, my strong rock and in him I find security.<br \/>\nTake Away: Only in the Lord do I find real security.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Splintered reeds don\u2019t make good crutches Ezekiel 31: Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, that pompous old goat&#8230;.
