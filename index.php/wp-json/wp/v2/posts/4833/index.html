The real action has been between mighty Egypt and mighty Babylonia. Egypt is the old power and Babylonia is the new. The small kingdoms that are unfortunate enough to be between the two are mere pawns in their chess match for domination of the region. Babylon wins. Having driven Egyptian forces out of the region, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon now turns his attention to subduing the small kingdoms of the region. Judah has been defeated once, but as Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s attention has been on other matters, Jehoiakim, king of Judah revolted, leading to a series of attacks by other smaller armies against Jerusalem. Judah has been driven to her knees as Nebuchadnezzar, himself, arrives to direct the assault on the small beleaguered country. Jerusalem surrenders and Babylonian forces plunder the city. There will be a few more stories to tell, but the grave is already dug and the end of Judah is at hand. There have been some less than perfect opportunities for Judah to remain a nation. For instance, Jehoiakim didn\u2019t have to rebel and could have continued to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar. Still, as we\u2019re reminded several times here, \u201cGod said it would happen.\u201d For them, this is Judgment Day. Anyone who thinks God is \u201ctoo good\u201d or \u201ctoo kind\u201d to pronounce condemnation on those who reject him should read the final chapters of 2 Kings.<br \/>\nTake Away: Never doubt that the holiness of the Lord means he will judge sin.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Out of the frying pan, into the fire 2Kings 24: The threat from Egypt was now over.
