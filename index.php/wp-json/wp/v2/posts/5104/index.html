His comments range from direct replies to their statements to his view of the world and the inequities he sees in it.  A portion of these thoughts are focused on how things have changed for him.  There was a time, he remembers, when he was wonderfully blessed by the Lord, and, he says, &#8220;Everything was going my way.&#8221;  Job handled these blessings well.  Instead of it all going to his head, he became a friend to those who were going through loss or who needed help along the way.  Those were good days, but remembering them isn\u2019t a source of comfort to Job.  Instead, the memories add to his pain as he realizes he\u2019s lost more than wealth and health.  As I read Job&#8217;s story I note that loss comes in a wide variety of forms.  Job is unique because he lost it all at once, but it\u2019s painful to have even a small portion stripped away.  That includes loss of influence, which often comes with the passing of years.  Those who have given their lives in full time ministry aren\u2019t exempt from this.  The day comes when our ideas are no longer sought after and younger voices dominate the conversation about what God is doing &#8220;now.&#8221;  Like Job, it\u2019s natural to &#8220;long for the good old days.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: As time passes so does our influence.  It\u2019s possible to graciously accept that and to simply go on, trusting the Lord with that which is beyond our influence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A longing look back Job 30: How I long for the good old days.
