When I read the story of Noah and the flood I\u2019m not supposed to come away with a scientific understanding of how the flood happened. I\u2019m not supposed to whip out my calculator and try to figure out how many animals and provisions the ark would carry or study geology to prove there was really such a flood. Instead, I\u2019m to see that God has a plan to redeem humanity and that he&#8217;ll go to whatever extreme is necessary to get that done. I\u2019m also to appreciate Noah\u2019s obedience in spite of the seeming unreasonableness of his task and his being alone in accomplishing it. Now, that isn\u2019t to say this event is to be filed under the heading of \u201cparable.\u201d Just the details of the construction of the ark and the clear references to locale mark this as a historical event. The take away, though, isn\u2019t my charging off to prove the story is true or sharpening my debate skills so I can conquer the \u201cunbelievers\u201d with stories of gopher wood on Mount Ararat. Instead, I\u2019m to see God at work, redeeming humanity. I\u2019m to be impressed at what the Lord can do with just one obedient person and be challenged to obedience in areas of my life that are beyond my understanding. Rather than fighting battles on the scientific front, a wiser use of my energy is to deal with the eternal spiritual issues of this event.<br \/>\nTake away: It\u2019s easy to get caught up in battles and miss the main points.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Fighting the right battle Genesis 6: Noah did everything God commanded him to do.
