We simply turn the page and keep on reading. David returns to Ziklag after rescuing those who were taken captive and is, I guess, rebuilding the destroyed town. An Amalekite shows up in camp with what he thinks will be received as good news. Saul and Jonathan are dead. In fact, he claims (apparently a lie) that he personally finished Saul off. This fellow was probably robbing the dead on the battle field and came upon Saul\u2019s body. He thinks that having David indebted to him will be worth more than the royal headband and bracelet he took off of Saul\u2019s body. Clearly this guy doesn&#8217;t know David. After all, David has more reason to kill Saul than anyone, yet he has twice passed up the opportunity to do so. The bearer of bad news goes out to meet his Maker soon thereafter. David composes a song of lament over the death of Saul and Jonathan. He could have sung of disappointing failure and lost opportunities. Instead, he remembers the bravery of these two men and the security and prosperity they brought to Israel. As the Amalekite learned the hard way, cheering the death of even a deeply flawed individual isn\u2019t David\u2019s way. It\u2019s not God\u2019s way either.<br \/>\nTake Away: As the Lord is gracious and merciful to us, so should we be to all, even those who don\u2019t measure up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Song for a funeral 2 Samuel 1: \u201cYou asked for it,\u201d David told him.
