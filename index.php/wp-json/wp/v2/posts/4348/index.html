That is, they\u2019re passed along from parents to their children.  Some of the promises of God are like that.  Such promises are made to a people, a nation.  Because of that it could be said that the children inherit the promise from their parents.  Some generational issues are not exactly the property of the children in the way those big promises are, but because of human nature, they almost seem to be.  Parents have an influence on their children.  If that influence is godly the result is very likely a positive one.  On the other hand, if that influence is negative, it\u2019s very possible that things will begin to unravel more and more with each passing generation.  However, it doesn\u2019t need to be that way.  The reason is that God remains active from one age to the next.  Moses tells his listeners that the relationship God had with their parents, a relationship that was broken by their disobedience, is now offered to them.  They won&#8217;t say, &#8220;We\u2019re God&#8217;s people because our parents were God&#8217;s people.&#8221;  Instead, they\u2019ll be his people because God has called them and they\u2019ve responded to that invitation.  It\u2019s a wonderful thing when parents pass their faith along to their children.  It is even better when the children actively respond making that relationship to God their very own.<br \/>\nTake Away: A person who had godly parents is blessed, indeed.  Still, that person has the responsibility of claiming that blessing \u2013 that relationship- as their very own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Inherited blessings and personal decisions Deuteronomy 5: God didn&#8217;t just make this covenant with our parents; he made it also with us, with all of us who are alive right now.
