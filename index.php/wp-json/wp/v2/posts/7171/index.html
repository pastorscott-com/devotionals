I was taken with the quiet confidence and good nature of the young lady who took our order.  The job she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t the highest paying, but she\u2019s doing it with real class.  Like many people who are &#8220;flipping burgers&#8221; that job is just a temporary stopping point for her along the way.  The point of this proverb isn\u2019t that we\u2019re to demand respect, refusing to be anyone&#8217;s doormat.  Instead, it\u2019s that we\u2019re to do whatever it is we do with excellence and pride and that will, in itself, demand respect.  Those who think they\u2019re &#8220;saving&#8221; their best for some dream job and just &#8220;getting by,&#8221; giving the least effort possible in some temporary place in life, are the ones who are accepting the &#8220;doormat&#8221; position in life.  That young lady who was asking &#8220;would you like to super-size that order?&#8221; gets it and I seriously doubt she\u2019s in danger of being forgotten in the end.<br \/>\nTake Away: A person can do whatever they do with class \u2013 and when they do, people take note.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you want fries with that?
