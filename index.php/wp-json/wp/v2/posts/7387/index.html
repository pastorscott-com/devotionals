Aside from the conclusion to his writings in the last pages of the book we&#8217;re about to move to an &#8220;appendix&#8221; of some of his prophecies concerning other nations.  Just before we do that, we find the brief words of chapter 45.  Obviously, this is out of place and would fit better back in chapter 36.  It&#8217;s in that chapter that we find the story of Jeremiah&#8217;s dictating his gloom and doom message to his loyal secretary, Baruch.  This good man writes it all down, not once, but twice.  Baruch, then, is very aware of what&#8217;s coming, and frankly that knowledge scares him to death.  The king might deny it all and act to silence the messenger.  Baruch, though, believes every word he\u2019s written.  In an act of mercy, Jeremiah informs his faithful secretary that now he has a message specifically for him.  God&#8217;s word for this good man is this: &#8220;Things are going to get worse, but don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to take care of you and see you through this whole business.&#8221;  I can just imagine Baruch&#8217;s blood pressure dropping several points as Jeremiah states these words of assurance to him.  I can&#8217;t find any prophecies in the Bible with my name on them, but I do find plenty of promises addressed to those who put their trust in the Lord.  Like Baruch, then, I have a word from the Lord to hold on to even when things are in the &#8220;getting worse&#8221; stage.  I don&#8217;t have to be consumed with worry because God has promised life to me.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s a great comfort in troubling times to remember that the Lord has promised life to me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A personal promise from the Lord Jeremiah 45: I&#8217;ll keep you alive through the whole business.
