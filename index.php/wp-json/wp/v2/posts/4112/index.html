However, it isn\u2019t long before things get complicated. The interaction between Jacob\u2019s family and the natives of the land turns ugly with a rape and then retaliation that includes murder. It\u2019s time for them to go and the Lord names the place: Bethel. It was at Bethel that the Lord first appeared to Jacob when he was on the run from his brother. Now, he moves his entire family and all his belongings to Bethel. Apparently, it comes just in time. Not only are the locals preparing for war against them, but many of Jacob\u2019s entourage has begun to dabble in the religions of the region. It\u2019s time for Jacob and family to go to Bethel. When he arrives he builds a new altar to the Lord there. The name \u201cBethel\u201d means \u201cHouse of God.\u201d Jacob names the altar \u201cEl-Bethel\u201d meaning \u201cThe God of the House of God.\u201d He isn\u2019t only bringing his family to the place where he met God; he\u2019s bringing them to God, Himself. I know it\u2019s quite a stretch, but I can\u2019t help but think of our own efforts to impact our families for God. It isn\u2019t enough to insist that they behave themselves or even attend church with us. We need to bring them to God, Himself. Without that, everything else is just sideline stuff that\u2019s bound to fail.<br \/>\nTake away: We need to do all we can to bring our loved ones to a personal relationship with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The God of the House of God Genesis 35: He built an altar there and named it El-Bethel (God-of-Bethel).
