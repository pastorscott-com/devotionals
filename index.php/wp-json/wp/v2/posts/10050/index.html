Here I find a series of helpful and challenging concepts. There\u2019s enough material here for an entire book, making it difficult for a writer to pick just one thing and focus on it. Paul\u2019s summary, though, is attention getting. Christians, I\u2019m told, live in a world containing plenty of evil. Opportunities to do wrong abound with even good things, like having personal resources, carrying with them some built in temptations. With the potential of wrong attached to everything from spiritual gifts to that which is obviously wrong how does a Christian cope? The best way, according to this passage is \u201cby doing good.\u201d I take each circumstance of life and ask, \u201cWhat good thing can I do here?\u201d Some things are easily understood. For instance, if I have the gift of teaching, I stick to my teaching, using that gift for good. Some things are quite understandable but harder to apply: if I have an enemy, I do good by blessing him rather than quietly cursing him. If I don\u2019t have a clue as to what to do, I do my best, believing God will take care of it. This, I\u2019m told is the secret to overcoming evil. I beat it by doing good.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: This is easier said than done, but, by God\u2019s grace, it can be done.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Overcoming evil Romans 12: Get the best of evil by doing good.
