Frankly, he doesn&#8217;t think he\u2019s up to it.  After all, what will he say?  He feels inadequate for the task.  The Lord understands.  In fact, the Lord probably agrees that Jeremiah\u2019s an unlikely prophet.  However, the Lord isn&#8217;t necessarily looking for the most capable person anyway.  For reasons known only to him, the Lord chose an unlikely person for a very important job.  To encourage Jeremiah, the Lord puts words in his mouth, a demonstration of how it will work.  Today, I very much identify with Jeremiah.  As a young person I felt God&#8217;s call on my life.  Growing up in a small, wonderfully supportive church I marched forward with the confidence of youth.  It was during my first year in college that I realized I&#8217;m, at best, a very average person.  One day, as I faced my inadequacies the Lord took mercy on me as he did for Jeremiah in this passage.  As I read Matthew 10 these words became a personal promise to me: &#8220;Do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.&#8221;  It seemed to me that the Lord said to me, &#8220;If I could give words to the disciples even when they were being abused, I can help you as a preacher to say things I want you to say.&#8221;  That day was a &#8220;Jeremiah 1&#8221; day for me.  It wasn&#8217;t that I now understood all there was to know, but I grasped this promise of God to me.  If he called me to the ministry, he would help me do ministry.  Over 40 years later, I can report that the Lord has been faithful to keep that promise.<br \/>\nTake Away: If the Lord calls you to it he will help you do it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Speaking God\u2019s Word Jeremiah 1: I&#8217;ve just put my words in your mouth.
