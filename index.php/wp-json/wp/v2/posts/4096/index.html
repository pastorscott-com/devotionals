Because Abraham obeyed my summons and kept my charge.<br \/>\nAbraham is one of the great heroes of the Bible so it doesn\u2019t surprise us that his son, Isaac, seems pale in comparison to his colorful father. Isaac, in fact, is better known for things that happen to him than for things he does. As a child, Ishmael picks on him. On the mountain, he\u2019s the object of his father\u2019s greatest test of faith. Later on, a trusted servant gets a wife for him. He keeps getting pushed around by the people of the area, and then, as a poor blind man, he\u2019s deceived by his wife and son. In some ways, he\u2019s a historical place holder between Abraham and Jacob. I don\u2019t want to be too hard on Isaac. None of the things I mentioned about him would tend to produce a vibrant, powerful leader. Can\u2019t you imagine him on a modern psychiatrist\u2019s couch? Talk about a person with issues! Still, we see that God is with Isaac blessing him and multiplying his wealth. The scripture says the Lord does this because of Abraham. All the blessings the Lord promised his father spill over onto Isaac and are then passed on to the next generation. This is an example of God working according to his purposes and in view of the big picture. I\u2019m reminded today that sometimes I\u2019m the recipient of what might be called \u201caccidental blessings.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that God doesn\u2019t intentionally allow them into my life, but just that the blessing has a lot more to do with the obedience of others than it does me, or that I\u2019m blessed because of God\u2019s larger plan and not really because of anything specific about me. Such realizations ought to cause me to be humbly thankful for good things that come into my life.<br \/>\nTake away: When I\u2019m blessed I need to be humbly thankful and realize that, at times, they aren\u2019t about me at all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accidental Blessings Genesis 26: Any why?
