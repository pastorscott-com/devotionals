Ahab is already dead, killed in battle, and now his son Joram sits on the throne of Israel. However, the Lord is about to keep his word that this family will not remain in power. Elisha sends a \u201cjunior prophet\u201d to General Jehu. The prophet is to anoint him king and then he\u2019s to run for his life. Apparently, Jehu doesn\u2019t need much of a nudge to mount a coop and take over the country and almost immediately he moves decisively against Joram and his mother Jezebel. I\u2019m interested in the order of Elisha that his representative name Jehu king and then get away from him as quickly as possible. Apparently, in spite of his being anointed king, Jehu remains a heartless, wicked man who\u2019s going to be used of God but will never be a man of God. Elisha doesn\u2019t want his associate to have any more contact with such a man than is necessary. If that\u2019s correct, the lesson is that God\u2019s people sometimes need to make alliances with those who are far from being righteous. We\u2019re to work with them to accomplish some greater good but we\u2019re also to be careful to remember who we are and not allow ourselves to be pulled into their lifestyles.<br \/>\nTake Away: While the Lord uses unlikely and unworthy people to accomplish his purposes, his people should be careful in their connections to them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Run for your life 2Kings 9: Then open the door and get out of there as fast as you can.
