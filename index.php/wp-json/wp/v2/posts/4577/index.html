There\u2019s no peace for him, but instead, a constant, nagging fear.  He has power and authority and a certain kind of cunning, but things are going downhill for him.  David is his greatest irritant.  David is everything Saul should have been.  No one will actually say this to Saul, but in his heart he knows that David is the next king of Israel.  Of all people who should side with him in opposition to David, his son Jonathan should be first.  In this age, when the throne&#8217;s at stake, there\u2019s generally a bloody coop.  Jonathan should realize that, not only is his future position at stake, but his very life depends on dealing with David.  Jonathan, though, will have none of it.  He\u2019s the president of David&#8217;s fan club.  When Saul signs a death warrant for David, it\u2019s Jonathan who talks his father out of it.  Every time Jonathan appears in this story he\u2019s doing the right thing.  He fights the enemies of God with skill, bravery, and resourcefulness.  He\u2019s a friend to David without thought to himself.  He stands up to his father even when doing so can easily make himself the target of his father&#8217;s murderous rage.  It occurs to me that Jonathan reminds me of one of my favorite people in the book of Acts, the Son of Encouragement: Barnabas.  I thank God for people who simply do the right thing.  Often they aren&#8217;t the ones with the starring roles in life&#8217;s stories but they support the stars, like David or Paul.  Jonathan, like Barnabas, is a good role model for me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Jonathan\u2019s example of always doing the right thing should challenge and encourage us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>President of David\u2019s fan club 1 Samuel 19: I&#8217;ll go out and talk about you with my father and we&#8217;ll see what he says.
