I see him playing his harp and composing songs of praise to God with only a congregation of sheep hearing his music.  That, I think, is more myth than fact.  I\u2019ve recently read the psalm King David wrote after being confronted with his adultery with Bathsheba.  Now, in the 63rd Psalm I find him out in the Judean wilderness, as he and his loyal band is on the run from his enemies.  The setting is far from tranquil and his audience is not sheep, but warriors  Can\u2019t you imagine this rough and tumble fighting force gathering around the campfire to listen to their fearless leader play the harp and sing his latest composition to them.  I think that\u2019s exactly what happened!  In this case, David&#8217;s song is one of transparent praise to God.  He tells the Lord, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get enough of you,&#8221; proclaiming, &#8220;God &#8212; you&#8217;re my God.&#8221;  As David and his rag-tag army sit around the campfire they sing, not &#8220;kum-ba-ya,&#8221; but &#8220;here I am to worship.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t think I\u2019d want to be the person who wanders into that camp to tell these warriors that it\u2019s kind of sissy to sing such songs, and if I did, I\u2019d probably want to have a current life insurance policy!  Seriously, it\u2019s nice to be reminded that real men can really worship.<br \/>\nTake Away: Heartfelt worship can be a very masculine endeavor. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Real men sing together Psalm 63 I&#8217;ve worked up such hunger and thirst for God.
