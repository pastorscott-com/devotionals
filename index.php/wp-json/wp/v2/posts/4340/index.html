For 40 years he\u2019s struggled to keep this nation on the track God laid out for them.  They\u2019ve had both successes and failures.  Now, with the end of his life in sight this man of God urges them to stay alert.  He wants them to be aware that spiritual disaster sometimes comes bit by bit rather than all at once.  It\u2019s possible to become dully satisfied, to fail to be alert to negative changes in our attitudes, and to begin to drift spiritually.  The problem isn&#8217;t limited to individuals who temporarily lose sight of their goals.  Instead, such gradual failure can be national in nature.  It can also be generational when parents fail to pass their faith on to their children.  Having a current, connected, committed relationship to God is worth any effort it might take.  For those of us who are wonderfully blessed the danger isn&#8217;t that we\u2019ll wake up tomorrow morning and declare that we aren&#8217;t interested in God anymore.  Nor is it that we\u2019ll decide we aren&#8217;t going to attempt to influence our children to be genuine Christians.  The danger is that we will drift.  Moses says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let it happen &#8212; be aware of the little things and the big things will take care of themselves.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: While we can\u2019t stay self-focused all the time, once in a while it\u2019s a good idea to do a spiritual checkup.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Watch out for the little things Deuteronomy 4: Don&#8217;t let your heart wander off.
