In fact, he moves from the topic of his first letter to them to encourage them to be generous in their giving to a special relief offering he\u2019s collecting to be taken to the Christian poor in Jerusalem.  If you think about it it\u2019s quite an impressive thing he\u2019s doing.  These Gentiles wouldn\u2019t have given a second thought to some Jews living in Jerusalem just a few years earlier.  They felt no connection to them and they certainly wouldn\u2019t have considered sending them a relief offering.  Now, though, it\u2019s all changed.  Their lives are now linked to the lives of people throughout the region.  Before it was \u201cus and them\u201d but now it\u2019s all \u201cus.\u201d  What has happened?  Jesus!  His presence in their lives has made them part of a family.  These days, they not only know about fellow believers in distant Jerusalem, but they\u2019re willing to send them some of their hard earned cash to help them through hard times.  What Paul began so long ago continues to this day as Christians send offerings to people in distant places in the Name of Jesus.  God\u2019s people are the most generous people on the face of the earth.  The reason, according to Paul, is that we\u2019re behaving like our Heavenly Father who\u2019s the most generous Being there is.  We\u2019re part of a great family and our Father has set for us a powerful example of giving.  We give to all who are in need, but we\u2019re especially willing to give, even sacrificially, to help our brothers and sisters.  \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m a part of the family of God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: God\u2019s people are wonderfully generous people.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hum \u201cFamily of God\u201d as you read this one 2Corinthians 9: God loves it when the giver delights in the giving.
