The prophet Micaiah is one such man. King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah are discussing the possibility of joining forces in a campaign against Aram. Jehoshaphat wants to hear from God on this issue and Ahab, anticipating that, has a crew of hired prophets standing by. They tell the two kings that they\u2019ll be wildly successful if they go to war against Aram. However, Jehoshaphat\u2019s unconvinced. His question reflects both his spirituality and his lack of confidence in the hired prophets of Ahab. He asks for a real prophet of God. It\u2019s here that we meet Micaiah, unknown to us, but apparently well known to Ahab. The King of Israel says that there\u2019s one guy who can speak for God, but he hates him because he never says anything good about him! Upon Jehoshaphat\u2019s insistence Micaiah is called. As he comes, he\u2019s warned that anything negative he might say, as some lawman might put it, \u201cwill be used against him in a court of law.\u201d Micaiah starts off with pure sarcasm: &#8220;sure, go for it, you\u2019ll win a great victory.&#8221; It\u2019s so obvious that he\u2019s making fun of the hired prophets that Ahab presses him for the truth. Micaiah gives it to him, right between the eyes! All of his hired prophets are liars and God\u2019s going to use this war to be rid of Ahab once and for all. Our glimpse of Micaiah ends with his being drug out of the presence of the kings while shouting, &#8220;If you ever get back in one piece, I&#8217;m no prophet of God.&#8221; Then he adds that when everything happens just as he said he wants everyone to remember this event. Some people play big roles in the history of God&#8217;s work in this world and I thank the Lord for them. Others have just a bit part, but I can&#8217;t help but be impressed when they come through with flying colors. Today, I tip my hat to Micaiah, the prophet of God.<br \/>\nTake Away: As a \u201cbit player\u201d I too want to be ready when my moment comes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>He nailed it 1Kings 22: As surely as God lives, what God says, I&#8217;ll say.
