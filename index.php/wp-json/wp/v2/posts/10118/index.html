He wishes he was free, able to travel, preaching the gospel, visiting friends he\u2019s made through the years. How he misses Timothy. Despite the difference in their ages, they&#8217;re \u201cjoined at the hip\u201d in ministry. Not only are these two men united in ministry, but Paul knows Timothy\u2019s family and values the steady faithfulness of both his grandmother and mother. Now, Timothy has taken up the life of faith he first learned from these two women. How proud they must be of their son and grandson! I understand that as beings with free will that each person must make his or her own decision about spiritual things. However, I also know that having a godly heritage gives a young person a head start in spiritual matters. In fact, Timothy\u2019s testimony could be mine. Today, I thank God for a faithful mother and grandmother who nurtured me in the faith. Both of these who influenced me for the Lord are now in heaven. Perhaps there\u2019s someone who helped you to come to know the Lord early in life. If so, thank God for them. If possible, it might be a good idea to tell them how much you appreciate their godly influence on your life.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Thank the Lord for those who have touched your life in Jesus\u2019 Name \u2013 and if possible thank them too!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Passing the faith along 2Timothy 1: What a rich faith it is, handed down from your grandmother Lois to your mother Eunice, and now to you.
