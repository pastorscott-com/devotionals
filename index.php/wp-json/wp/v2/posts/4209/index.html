This God who spoke to Moses through the burning bush, this God who brought the plagues to Egypt in securing their freedom, this God who delivered them at the Red Sea now describes how they\u2019re to live.  He didn\u2019t bring them up out of Egypt so they could do their own thing, living as they pleased.  The Lord God brought them out of slavery to be his own people.  Their relationship to their God is going to be very different than the Egyptians relationship with their gods.  The very first thing their Redeemer does is state Ten Commandments to them.  These Commandments are just as focused on how a man treats his neighbor as how a man relates to his God.  In this new relationship with the Almighty they\u2019ll treat the Lord with absolute reverence, but they\u2019ll also treat one another with respect, honesty, and fairness.  One doesn\u2019t have to be Jewish or Christian to recognize the brilliance of the Ten Commandments.  In just a few words the foundation is laid for a God-fearing and just society.  To this day there\u2019s no finer expression of how society can function at its best.  This gift from God to his people is every bit as impressive as was his parting the Red Sea for them.<br \/>\nTake Away: We can find no better set of rules for living than what we find in the Ten Commandments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Ten Commandments Exodus 20: I am God, your God.
