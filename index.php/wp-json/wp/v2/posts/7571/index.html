There&#8217;s nothing mundane or middle of the road here as everything is at one end or the other end of the spectrum.  Here we see powerful love and painful betrayal.  We see the beauty of tender, marital sex and we also see the brutal, cheapening side of sex in the market place.  In one place we see the anger of God as he declares the coming destruction as a result of their sin but we also see God&#8217;s mercy as he promises restoration.  There&#8217;s nothing in Hosea that lends itself to a relaxing late night read before sleep.  This book is an emotional rollercoaster.  God&#8217;s people have betrayed him and, because of that betrayal he&#8217;s rejected them, kicking them out.  Israel has committed spiritual adultery against God and God has issued a decree of divorce against them.  Then as we&#8217;re emotionally ready to close the book on this relationship the tone of the Lord changes.  He&#8217;s kicked them out and declared his anger with them and judgment on them.   Just as I get my mind around that the landscape suddenly changes.  The Lord declares his intentions to clean them up, to romance them again and ultimately to reinstate his marriage to them.  The sweep of all this is stunning and I realize I&#8217;m reading about a love that never gives up.  God is truly the God of Second Chances.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A love that never gives up Hosea 2: Then I&#8217;ll marry you for good &#8211; forever!
