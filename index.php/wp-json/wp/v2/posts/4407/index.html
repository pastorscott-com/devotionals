I&#8217;ve just arrived.&#8221;<br \/>\nI confess that I love these mysterious passages of the Bible.  As Joshua prepares for his first Canaan conquest battle he encounters a stranger who\u2019s holding a drawn sword.  Joshua asks his allegiance, and the answer is that this stranger is on neither side.  He\u2019s commander of God&#8217;s army and has only just arrived on the scene.  What\u2019s going on here?  God has an army?  He sends his commander to scout out the battlefield?  There are more questions than answers here.  Apparently, the commander of God&#8217;s army has come to give Joshua the heavenly battle plan.  As I continue reading, the &#8220;March around the City&#8221; strategy is given to Joshua.  In light of the abundance of unknown things in this little passage, I don&#8217;t want to go too far out in finding devotional material, but a few things come to mind.  First, God\u2019s ready to go to war on my behalf, even when I&#8217;m unaware of his presence.  Second, God doesn&#8217;t claim allegiance to me; I claim allegiance to him.  Third, God has a plan that may be very different than my own. Fourth, his plan is always the best one.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s good to know God has an army, that he\u2019s on my side, and that he has a sure fire, God-guaranteed plan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you with us or against us?
