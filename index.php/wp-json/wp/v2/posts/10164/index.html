However, not just anyone is qualified to open it. In fact, no one can be found and it appears to John as though his \u201crevelation\u201d isn\u2019t going to happen. Then, he sees a Lamb that appears both weak and strong at the same time; bearing marks of death but with traits of unequaled wisdom and strength. John hears one of the Elders call this Lamb \u201cthe Lion from Tribe Judah.\u201d We know about Judah. That\u2019s the royal family tree of Israel. King David was of that family; so is Jesus. The One John sees looks like a slain Lamb that&#8217;s very much alive and powerful. This Lamb is also a Lion \u2013 a conqueror. He takes the scroll but at that moment no one&#8217;s thinking of the scroll. All heaven bursts forth in praise for the Lamb-Lion. It\u2019s a thrilling moment as \u201cthousand after thousand after thousand\u201d of heavenly beings break forth in a song of praise. That group gets the first verse, then for the next one, all creation joins in. What a scene! There\u2019s more to read, more to be revealed, and more to consider. For the moment though, as happens in this scene of worship I think I\u2019ll just stop and join them in worshiping this Lamb-Lion-King.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Worship of Jesus is at the heart of all Creation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lamb, Lion, King Revelation 5: Look \u2013 the Lion from Tribe Judah, the Root of David\u2019s Tree, has conquered.
