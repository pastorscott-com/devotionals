How hard is it for the Lord to get a hearing in my life when everything\u2019s going well?  Troubles and trials drive me to prayer and there&#8217;s certainly nothing wrong with that.  How, though, about blessings?  At one level, I need to remember to thank God for all he does for me.  A beautiful sunrise ought to cause me to praise God for his handiwork.  Big blessings and little ones should bring forth genuine gratitude from my heart.  At another level, though, is my ability to hear and respond to the in-flight corrections the Lord has for me.  Can I learn to listen for them and respond to them even when all is well?  Does the Lord have to allow some unexpected trial into my life to get my attention?  Generally speaking, I think the Lord wants us to live wonderfully blessed lives.  Could it be possible that some trials would never come if I\u2019d simply pay more attention to the Lord&#8217;s voice during the days of sunshine?  I&#8217;m not sure how this fits into my broader theology of how God works in my life, but its food for thought today.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our problems drive us to prayer and so should our blessings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hearing God on the good days Jeremiah 22: I spoke to you when everything was going your way.
