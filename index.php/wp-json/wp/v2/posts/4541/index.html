Then, to illustrate that displeasure, Samuel prays up a thunderstorm! Now, that&#8217;s an &#8220;attention-getter!&#8221; The storm scares them to repentance and they plead with Samuel to pray for them. He promises his prayers and also assures them that God can work through the king arrangement. It may not be God&#8217;s first choice, but he can handle it as long as king and people cooperate with him. And, even though the Lord&#8217;s disappointed in their poor choices, he isn&#8217;t giving up on them. How does Samuel know this? He knows it because his knows God. &#8220;Because of who he is, he will be faithful to you.&#8221; Wow! What a relief! It\u2019s great to know that my relationship with God isn\u2019t performance- based. That doesn&#8217;t give me license to ignore God and do my own thing, but it does encourage me today. Even when I\u2019m functioning at peak capacity I tend to mess up. I\u2019m glad for this reminder that God doesn\u2019t walk out on people who make poor decisions.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord can work through even our poor decisions if we walk humbly with him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The big bang! 1 Samuel 12: God, simply because of who he is, is not going to walk off and leave his people.
