There have been high points, many of them.  For this I\u2019m thankful.  Also, there have been low points, though not so many.  I&#8217;m thankful for that too.  Out here in the middle, where I spend most of my time, things can get rather dry; sometimes with my not even realizing what\u2019s happening.  I go through my routine, focused on the common things of life and don&#8217;t even realize that some of the joy of living in God&#8217;s love has dried up.  The passage before me isn&#8217;t about the spiritual lives of individuals, but a nation of people.  Spiritually, they\u2019ve taken things for granted and the result is that they\u2019re as dry and fragile as the fallen leaves of autumn.  Isaiah&#8217;s word of hope to them is that there\u2019ll be an outpouring of God&#8217;s Spirit on their descendants.  This isn&#8217;t intended to say that they\u2019re doomed to dryness, but to encourage them that something better is coming for them and, even more, for their offspring.  While I know this passage isn&#8217;t specifically about my &#8220;somewhere in the middle&#8221; spiritual dryness I do see a truth here that I can take to heart: God wants to have a vibrant, flowing relationship with his people.  If I\u2019ll trust him and wait for it, he\u2019ll &#8220;pour water&#8221; on my heart&#8217;s &#8220;thirsty ground&#8221; when the time is right.  That\u2019s worth waiting for.  &#8220;Mercy drops &#8217;round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord wants to have a vibrant, flowing relationship with us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pleading for showers of blessing Isaiah 44: I will pour water on the thirsty ground.
