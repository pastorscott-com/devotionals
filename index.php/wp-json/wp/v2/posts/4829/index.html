When the boy-king Josiah comes to power things have eroded to the point that even the priests at the Temple don&#8217;t know God&#8217;s Word to them. As Josiah grows up he wants to do the right thing even though he\u2019s unsure of what the right thing is. Out of respect for God, he decides to renovate the Temple and it\u2019s while that work is being done that Scripture is found. The message is not a pleasant, comforting one. Instead, its words declare the covenant made between God and Josiah&#8217;s ancestors. That covenant contains words of blessing but also states, in graphic terms, what will happen if they break that covenant. As Josiah hears these words the seriousness of the situation dawns upon him. He and his people are clearly candidates for the &#8220;curse&#8221; part of the covenant. He\u2019s heartbroken and he\u2019s frightened. He sends word to a woman of God asking for her intercession. The message she receives from God is both positive and negative. It\u2019s negative in its confirmation that all the curses of the covenant will come true. Simply put, God will keep his word. It\u2019s positive in that God is taking Josiah&#8217;s repentance and commitment to the Almighty seriously. Once again the curse is put on hold. As a result, Josiah will rule in peace throughout his life. Even as the Lord takes Josiah seriously he takes me seriously. That doesn&#8217;t mean my saying &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; will stop events that are already in motion from happening. It does mean that the Lord\u2019s willing to hear and forgive when I call out to him.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God taking us seriously 2Kings 22: I&#8217;m taking you seriously.
