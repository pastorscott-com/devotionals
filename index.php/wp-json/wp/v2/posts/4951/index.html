Here we see his tiny nation threatened by the mighty Assyrian army. Sennacherib, himself, has come to oversee the defeat of Judah and the capture of Jerusalem. The siege starts with psychological warfare. With the huge Assyrian army camped out nearby messengers come to intimidate Hezekiah and try to divide the loyalty of the people. Of course the threat is real. Assyria has marched across the region defeating one nation after another. When Sennacherib says that Judah is next he\u2019s deadly serious. Hezekiah responds in some practical ways. For one thing he plugs up the springs that the enemy army might use as a water supply. However, we\u2019re told that his primary response is to pray. I love the picture I see here. For Hezekiah prayer isn\u2019t the \u201clast ditch because I\u2019ve tried everything else\u201d approach. This man has learned a valuable lesson: when he prays, God answers. It seems that I have to often return to this basic lesson. Even when I have a wealth of evidence that prayer makes all the difference in the world my first response to many life events is to try to handle things myself. It\u2019s only when that fails that I get serious about praying. Know what? I don\u2019t think the problem is unique to me! \u201cO what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: Prayer is to be our first response.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praying man 2 Chronicles 32: King Hezekiah\u2026responded by praying.
