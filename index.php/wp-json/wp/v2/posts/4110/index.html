He was born right after his twin brother Esau and he came out of the womb holding the heel of his brother; apparently trying to get a bit of a free ride! Esau grew up to be a down to earth, hardworking guy and Jacob grew up to be a person who takes advantage of down to earth, hardworking guys. Now it\u2019s time to face the music. Blessed beyond his wildest dreams he, who left home with nothing, returns home with wives, children, servants, and a wealth of livestock. The first thing he has to do is to make things right with Esau. Jacob showers his brother with gifts. Actually, Esau has also done alright. Still, Jacob insists and his reason is the right one. \u201cGod has been good to me and I have more than enough.\u201d It\u2019s time to make things right with his brother. Jacob gives God the credit, acknowledging his blessings, and freely shares out of his abundance. Having said all that, I can add my own testimony. God\u2019s been good to me too, and I also have more than enough. How can I use God\u2019s abundant provision in my life to be a blessing to someone today? How about you? How has the Lord treated you?<br \/>\nTake away: How should a blessed person act?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s been good to me Genesis 34: God has been good to me and I have more than enough.
