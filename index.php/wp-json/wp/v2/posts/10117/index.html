Paul&#8217;s concerned about church leaders who see their position as a way to make some easy money. Timothy&#8217;s warned to identify such people as quickly as possible to keep them from infecting the whole church with their \u201cgerms of envy, controversy\u2026\u201d and other equally bad stuff. Timothy, himself, as a man of God, is to pursue, not money, but \u201cwonder, faith, love, steadiness, courtesy.\u201d Finally, Paul addresses how Timothy&#8217;s to deal with those who are already wealthy. He\u2019s to warn them to not be money centered but, instead, to handle their riches in the same way the Lord handles his: with extravagant generosity, helping others out of their bounty. Even though this is a short course on the topic of money and the church we find here a well-rounded treatment of the subject. First, watch out for church leaders who are in it for the money. Second, the pastor must be careful to not get caught up on the pursuit of money. Finally, those who do have money are to handle it with care, letting the generosity of the Lord, himself, be their example.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Money doesn\u2019t have to be a curse \u2013 rather it can be a way in which we reflect the generosity of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Money matters 1Timothy 6: A devout life does bring wealth, but it\u2019s the rich simplicity of being yourself before God.
