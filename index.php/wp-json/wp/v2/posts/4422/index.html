That\u2019s okay with me.  As I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m rather uncomfortable with all the blood and death involved in this march across Canaan.  We\u2019re given a list of defeated kings, starting with the first battle at Jericho.  In all, thirty-one are listed.  These battles continued for years, even decades, and after I see this list of battles won I\u2019m told that Joshua\u2019s now a senior citizen.  All in all, Joshua and all of the Israelites should feel good about what they\u2019ve accomplished.  However, even as the Lord speaks to Joshua in complimentary terms, he also reminds him that there\u2019s more for Israel to do.  In fact, the Lord has a list of places that are yet to be occupied.  He assures Joshua that this task isn\u2019t his, God, himself, will handle the clearing of the land in preparation for the continued expansion of their territory.  Even though Joshua\u2019s day is winding down, the Lord is looking ahead to the next step, the continuation of his grand plan.  It\u2019s reasonable to be reminded here that God not only works in my life, walking with me day by day but he also sees the big picture that I don\u2019t see.  I serve him, cooperating with his purposes in all my life, but when my day is done, the Lord doesn\u2019t close up shop and call it a day.  He continues right on into the next chapter, and the next.  As I read this passage I find that truth to be somewhat humbling.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord sees a bigger picture than we see.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s next Joshua 13: This is the land that remains.
