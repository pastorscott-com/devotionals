On one hand, I&#8217;m a mere speck in the Universe, practically invisible in comparison to God&#8217;s wondrous Creation.  Honestly, sometimes I get this and sometimes I don&#8217;t.  Rick Warren starts his famous Purpose Driven Life book with the words, &#8220;It&#8217;s not about you&#8221; and I can read that and respond, &#8220;Yes, I know!&#8221;   Other times I get caught seeing things only from my tiny perspective: &#8220;Why are they singing that song again?  I don&#8217;t like it nearly as much as I like the others.  Let&#8217;s sing some southern gospel, that&#8217;s my kind of music!&#8221;  At times like that it doesn&#8217;t hurt for me to remember that the worship service isn&#8217;t really designed for me in the first place.  Still, I know I can go too far with this humility stuff.  Back in the Stone Age of my childhood church kids were taught to say, &#8220;God didn&#8217;t make any junk.&#8221;  I\u2019m valued by the Lord.  Still, once in a while it&#8217;s a good idea for me to look around and realize that everything isn&#8217;t in orbit around me after all and to join David in humbly asking the Almighty, &#8220;Why do you bother with &#8221; me at all?<br \/>\nTake Away: It really isn\u2019t all about me \u2013 or you!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Perspective Psalm 8: Why do you bother with us?
