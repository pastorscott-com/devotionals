All of that building takes a lot out of the nation. When Solomon\u2019s laid to rest and his son Rehoboam ascends to the throne his subjects come to him with a reasonable request: \u201cgive us a break!\u201d For a generation they\u2019ve faithfully served his father, focusing their efforts on accomplishing his grand projects. Now, they want to put their efforts into building their own lives, capitalizing on the prosperity Solomon brought to them. Rehoboam goes to his father\u2019s advisors and asks for their opinion and they agree with the people. These folks were committed to Solomon, but Rehoboam is starting new. If he\u2019ll back off and show compassion his father\u2019s people will become his people. These advisors wisely add that, in the long run, he\u2019ll get more accomplished by getting the people on his side than he\u2019d ever get done by using his sovereign authority and just ordering them to work. I know that Rehoboam foolishly listens to the advisors of his own generation and manages to split the country but, for the moment, I\u2019m taken with the wisdom of the first advice he receives. I think there are times when a leader sees a bigger picture than others do. At times like that, he or she may have to prod people to move in the right direction. However, most of the time a leader who conducts himself or herself as a servant who cares for people and has compassion on them is going to accomplish more. A leader who appreciates what people do, who has their best interests at heart, and who is willing to listen to what they say is going to almost always get more done.<br \/>\nTake Away: People follow leaders who they believe have their best interests at heart.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can draw more flies with sugar&#8230;. 2 Chronicles 10: Be considerate of their needs&#8230;they\u2019ll end up doing anything for you.
