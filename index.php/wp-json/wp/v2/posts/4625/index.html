All this blows David away too. He goes into the presence of the Lord to express his thanks. Along with that is a real sense of unworthiness on his part. While David\u2019s done a lot of the right things, this isn&#8217;t God responding to David\u2019s deeds. Instead, this is God acting out of his goodness and David responding as he ought to respond. It&#8217;s true of me too. Oh how blessed I am! God is good to me in wonderful ways. He\u2019s blessed me, not because I\u2019m more spiritual, or more obedient than others. He\u2019s blessed me because of his goodness. Like David, I\u2019m blown away by all the Lord has done and is doing for me.
