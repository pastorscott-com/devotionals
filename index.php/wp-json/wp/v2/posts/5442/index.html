I&#8217;ll be taking to a man about something, maybe a business deal, and his language will have words and phrases that Christians don&#8217;t use. Then, when he finds out I\u2019m a pastor it all changes. I&#8217;ve even had people who started off using God&#8217;s name in some inappropriate way shift clear over to telling me how good God has been to them. Needless to say, I&#8217;m not impressed by such a sudden change of language. In this passage, the Lord&#8217;s complaint against Israel isn\u2019t that they refuse to speak the language of God or that they\u2019ve forsaken prayer. In fact, they say and do a lot of the right things. The problem is that none of it is backed up in their lives. They give God lip service and then turn back to their chosen life style. There&#8217;s a caution in this for all of us. It isn&#8217;t just a potty-mouthed used car salesman or a backslidden Israelite who should be concerned here. I talk the language of &#8220;Zion&#8221; a lot and that\u2019s as it should be. However, when I&#8217;m not being &#8220;spiritual&#8221; what is it that I do and say? The measure of religion isn\u2019t how loudly I sing in church. All that &#8220;religious stuff&#8221; has to translate into how I relate to people when I am standing in line at McDonald&#8217;s or driving in traffic during rush hour.<br \/>\nTake Away: What we say and do at church needs to be translated into what we say and do outside of church.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taking it out of the church and into McDonald\u2019s Isaiah 48: But do you mean it?
