Some think that\u2019s a bad thing. I think it was just practice. Still, once he started building things David\u2019s son could hardly stop himself. In fact, Solomon\u2019s psychology is that of an impulsive overachiever. From the rest of his story, especially from the Book of Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs I see Solomon being consumed by one thing after another. At the beginning of his story he asks for and receives the gift of wisdom, now he can\u2019t rest until he has mastered whatever it is that catches his attention. In fact, the same thirst for understanding that causes him to be a great builder and king will become his downfall as he becomes infatuated with the women he marries and then their various gods. I don\u2019t think the Lord sat Solomon up for a fall in granting him wisdom, but I do think that the seed of failure was in it. In fact, I think that all gifts granted to us: natural ability, attributes, and talents have the potential of being a great blessing or the source of great failure for us. In Solomon, even as we celebrate his wisdom and understanding of an encyclopedia of things, we see a red flag of warning that there\u2019s danger in natural abilities. These things must be continually balanced by an honest admission that we\u2019re incomplete without God, who brings balance to even the most gifted life.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the Lord gifts us in any way the wise course of action is to bring those gifts right back to him and place them under his authority.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Psychoanalyzing Solomon 2 Chronicles 8: Solomon built impulsively and extravagantly.
