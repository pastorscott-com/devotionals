Songs are about, well, sound: music and singing, instrumentals and key changes.  Now I\u2019m told that it doesn&#8217;t always take some meaningful praise song to have meaningful praise.  David, that famous song writer and harp player, says that silence can be full of praise.  One of his examples is found in nature.  Not only does he see praise in the crashing of the waves but he also sees it when those things &#8220;come to a stop.&#8221;  Also, he hears songs of praise in the stillness of the dawn or as dusk settles on the land.  Silence is a missing element in most of our lives.  I tend to treat silence as a small child treats darkness.  In other words, I want a &#8220;night light&#8221; of sound; maybe the radio playing in the background.  My prayers are filled with the sound of my own voice and when I run out of things to say I think that means my prayer is finished.  David reminds me that silence is a perfectly acceptable form of praise.  Learning to worship in silence is a powerful lesson to learn.  It\u2019s an element almost completely absent from our public and even personal worship experiences.<br \/>\nTake Away: Those who learn to worship in silence have learned a powerful lesson of worship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Be still and know&#8230; Psalm 65: Silence is praise to you. &#8220;Silence is praise to you.&#8221; What an interesting phrase to be found in the world&#8217;s most famous book of songs.
