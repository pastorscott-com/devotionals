The gift of a son &#8212; for us!<br \/>\nSometimes the prophet does exactly what we generally think of a prophet doing: he speaks of the future.  Isaiah says that even when oppressors come and seem to destroy everything that God will have the last word.  That Word, Isaiah says, will be in the person of a Child who can rightly be called names like &#8220;Strong God&#8221; and &#8220;Eternal Father.&#8221;  Have you ever wondered about the state of mind of men like Isaiah when they speak words like this?  Does Isaiah see it all: manger, shepherds, and wise men?  Or does he scratch his head and wonder why he just said that?  I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.  I can give a very minor personal example of what I mean.  A few weeks ago I was delivering my Sunday morning sermon and found myself emphasizing something that had originally been only a minor part of my sermon.  Such an event is hard to describe to people who haven&#8217;t preached, but I think most everyone who has carried on spiritual conversations have, at times, experienced something similar.  Honestly, as I thought about that sermon and remembered who was in the congregation I had the idea that maybe the Lord wanted to encourage a good person who was going through some challenges in their life.  Still it never crossed my mind to &#8220;aim&#8221; that portion of the sermon at anyone.  I was surprised that I had pursued that point as far as I did.  A few days later, with no thought of that sermon, I was praying and dealing with what I thought was a totally unrelated issue.  Suddenly, the words that I had said on Sunday morning came back to me and I realized that on an entirely different level they were meant for me!  At that moment, the &#8220;deeper meaning&#8221; of what I had said became real to me.  I think that prophets like Isaiah operate at that level when they speak of things like those in Isaiah 9.  Had you had a frank conversation with Isaiah about his promise of the &#8220;gift of a son&#8221; I think he would have plugged it into some current situation in his nation.  That isn&#8217;t to say he was ignorant of there being more than he could grasp, but that, for him, these words applied right then and there.  Only as God&#8217;s plan is played out does the greater meaning of the old prophet&#8217;s words come to light.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even when we think we know what\u2019s going on we\u2019re often surprised to later realize that the Lord was working at levels beyond our grasp.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dual level preaching Isaiah 9: For a child has been born &#8212; for us!
