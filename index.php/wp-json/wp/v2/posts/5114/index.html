Now, after Job has demanded an audience with God in which he could straighten things out, God speaks, not to explain things to Job but to declare himself to him.  Surely the One who runs the universe is not subject to us!  We see here that God isn\u2019t especially interested in our having answers to all of life&#8217;s questions.  He is interested though, in our knowing him.  Job&#8217;s encounter with God is centered on all the mysteries of creation.  Job needs to not only have a better understanding of God, but he needs a clearer understanding of himself and his relationship to the Lord.  Of course, the same is true of us.  As I better understand who God is and who I am, I realize that my questions aren\u2019t as important as I first thought.<br \/>\nTake Away: I\u2019ll never have all the answers anyway, but I can trust God to be the answer to the deepest needs of my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Questions and the Answer Job 41: I&#8217;m in charge of all this &#8212; I run the universe!
