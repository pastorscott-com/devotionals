It\u2019s about sacrifices and offerings and dedicating children and skin diseases.  The most direct application of the rules and regulations of Leviticus pertain to the work of the Levites (those who served at the Tabernacle) and not very much to us.  The instructions given touch on almost all aspects of how these Israelites of thousands of years ago were to live.  In fact, it\u2019s the \u201calmost all\u201d character of these regulations that opens the fuller meaning of Leviticus to us.  God is coming down off the mountain to dwell among them.  He\u2019s going to inhabit the Tabernacle but that\u2019s not all there is to it.  He\u2019s involving himself in every aspect of their lives.  Of course, that includes the sacrificial system but it also includes how they&#8217;ll handle the messy part of their humanity.  It includes their religious feasts and festivals but it also includes how they conduct their business affairs.  I may read the prohibition against priests shaving their heads and see it as a quaint old historical fact, but when I put the whole scope of Leviticus into play I see God\u2019s connection to every part of their lives, including how they cut their hair.  I never doubt that God&#8217;s interested in how I go about worshipping him, and I\u2019m familiar enough with the Ten Commandments to know that he insists on righteous living.  However, Leviticus reminds me that the Lord&#8217;s also interested in the \u201cnon-religious\u201d and \u201cno-moral-aspect\u201d parts of my life too.  That doesn\u2019t mean he intends to dictate how I handle the mundane details of my life, but it does mean he\u2019s interested in such things and that he sees beyond the surface to the deeper meaning of things I may take for granted.<br \/>\nTake Away:  The Lord wants to participate in all my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rules and regs Leviticus 1: God called Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting.
