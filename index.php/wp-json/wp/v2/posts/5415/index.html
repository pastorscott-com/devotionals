He\u2019ll do an even greater thing than bringing a scattered people back to their homeland.&#8221;  Isaiah looks to the coming of the Messiah, a man filled with the Spirit who\u2019ll &#8220;set everything right.&#8221;  One day, in Isaiah&#8217;s distant future, a man will be baptized and God&#8217;s voice will be heard proclaiming, &#8220;This is my Son.&#8221;  Here we see that proclamation being foretold as the Lord declares through Isaiah, &#8220;He&#8217;s the one I chose, and I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with him.&#8221;  The prophet doesn&#8217;t have all the details.  In fact, it\u2019s unlikely that he has a vision of Calvary or of the empty tomb of Easter.  Isaiah doesn&#8217;t see a cross, but he does see a Messiah.  This Promised One will overcome every hindrance to accomplish his work.  That\u2019s just what happens when even a cross can&#8217;t stop this Servant of God.  Know what? Neither can he be stopped by the seeming insurmountable obstacles of the world today.  We Christians need to remember this and join the Messiah&#8217;s mission.  Followers of his don&#8217;t sit around wringing their hands while lamenting the state of things.  This Messiah won&#8217;t quit until things are set &#8220;right on earth.&#8221;  That\u2019s our mission as well as our hope.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t any challenges because there are.  Still, the fact remains that the Son of God will, without question accomplish his mission of redemption. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The great Deliverer Isaiah 42: He won&#8217;t be stopped until he&#8217;s finished his work &#8212; to set things right on earth.
