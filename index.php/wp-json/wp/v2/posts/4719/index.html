Jeroboam, the first king of Israel, messes up \u201croyally\u201d and God tells him he\u2019s going to toss him out like the garbage. Rehoboam, son of wise Solomon and grandson of faithful David, also fails. He follows Jeroboam in selling out to the worship of the idol Asherah. Meanwhile the precious Temple is raided by Egyptian forces and much of its wealth carried off even as Judah and Israel make war with one another. After Rehoboam&#8217;s son, Abijah, rules for just three years, his grandson, Asa, comes to the throne. Finally there\u2019s some good news. Asa picks up where his ancestor David left off some 60 years earlier. He isn&#8217;t quite the man David was, but he\u2019s like David where it matters most: &#8220;his heart is in the right place.&#8221; As we learned way back when we saw David being anointed as king, God looks on the heart. Today, my relationship with the Lord isn\u2019t performance based. I certainly want to be pleasing to the Lord in all I do, but that isn&#8217;t the bottom line. More than proper performance, God wants, in me, a heart that\u2019s right. My prayer is for a heart that\u2019s in tune with God.<br \/>\nTake Away: I want to always do the right thing, but even more, I want to always be the right person in the eyes of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The heart of the matter 1Kings 15: His heart was in the right place, in tune with God.
