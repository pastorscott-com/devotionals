I\u2019m reading about clean and unclean foods, infections, woman\u2019s stuff, and mildew. Frankly, it\u2019ll get worse before it gets better.  A quick peek ahead reveals a riveting chapter on bodily discharges.  I can hardly wait!  Of course, I\u2019m kidding about these chapters being everyone\u2019s favorite.  I wonder how many New Year\u2019s resolutions to read the Bible through have been shipwrecked right here in these chapters of Leviticus!  Still, I\u2019m taken with God\u2019s interest in every part of their lives.  This call to holiness reaches deeper than their making sacrifices for their sins or their being sure they show proper reverence to the Lord and his Tabernacle.  When a person gets an infection he\u2019s not only to deal with it from the aspect of personal hygiene but from a spiritual point of view too.  Know what, this isn\u2019t as far off the beam as one might think.  A while back I went through two rounds of antibiotics trying to get rid of a sinus infection.  Somewhere in the dreary days of the second week of that infection, I reminded the Lord that, while I knew there were lots of other concerns in the world, I wouldn\u2019t mind his help in healing that infection.  As I remember those unwelcome days in light of these chapters of Leviticus I\u2019m reminded that God\u2019s in play in the everyday bumps in the road of life.  The specifics of dealing with some of those things has changed, but the basics haven\u2019t changed all that much.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord\u2019s interest in our lives goes way beyond our reading our Bibles and going to church.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The more things change the more they stay the same Leviticus 13: The priest will examine the sore on the skin.
