Still, there are some gems to be found along the way.  When talking about vows, the words of Moses feel a bit more like one is reading in the books of Wisdom than the Law. Here, I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s easier to make promises than it is to keep them.  I\u2019ve heard young people make big claims about what they\u2019re going to do.  One said she was going to be a lawyer and another said he was going to enter the ministry.  They had big plans and I believe they were sincere about them.  However, they first had to work through the smaller details like getting out of bed and going to class each day.  I understand that Moses is talking about vows made to God here but I see that to great extent even vows made to God are first vows a person makes to oneself.   &#8220;This is worth doing, and I\u2019m going to do it.&#8221;  That works whether I\u2019m talking about doing something for the Lord, or pursing some life goal, or living in harmony with those around me.  The council here isn\u2019t against making promises.
