They aren\u2019t interested in hearing sermons about repentance and judgment, but they\u2019d love to hear sermons that tell them how to get God to do stuff for them.  Such a preacher is sure to be hired on the spot.  Obviously, this desire isn\u2019t limited to Micah\u2019s day.  For many people manipulating God is what religion&#8217;s all about.  Many years earlier the suffering Job says, \u201cThough he slay me, yet will I hope in him.\u201d (Job 13:15)  Earlier, Job had gotten an enormous amount of stuff from God.  Now, it\u2019s all gone and all he has left is a broken life and a stubborn faith.  So which approach to God describes me?  Am I in it for what I can get?  What if everything I hold dear is taken from me and it seems God&#8217;s no longer playing Santa Claus?  On one hand, we have people who don\u2019t want to hear what God has to say but are very interested in what they can get God to do.  On the other hand, we have a man who&#8217;s so committed to God that even when most of his theology has crashed he insists on continuing to hope in the Lord.  I pray I never have to travel Job\u2019s road but I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t want to follow that of the people of Micah\u2019s day.<br \/>\nTake Away: Do we serve the Lord for what we think we might get from him?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Getting stuff from God Micah 2: I\u2019ll preach sermons that will tell you how to get anything you want from God.
