Aside from the name and that he is from a town or country called Massa we\u2019re pretty much in the dark about him.  The name, I\u2019m told, doesn\u2019t appear to be Israelite, but is more Arab sounding.  Of course, Solomon rules a vast empire and has friendly relations with many countries.  It may be that Agur Ben Yakeh is considered to be a very wise man in his home country and that Solomon agrees, collecting his sayings and including him in his book of Proverbs.  However, there\u2019s a bit of a problem with this idea because the nation of Israel alone worships Jehovah God at this time.  Clearly, the words of Agur Ben Yakeh are those of a worshiper of God.  I know these little things are often of more interest to me than to others, but it is kind of fun to think about this ancient mystery.  If the identity of Ben Yakeh is mysterious, his opening proverb is pretty straight forward.  He isn\u2019t impressed by people who doubt the existence of God.  They may think they can ignore God and his commandments but when they do it isn&#8217;t the commandments that get broken!  The wise man says &#8220;every promise of God proves true.&#8221;  He warns those who doubt that to reconsider, warning, &#8220;he might take you to task and show up your lies.&#8221;  The day\u2019s coming when everyone will believe in God.  After all, we\u2019ll stand before him in Judgment.  Those who doubt will be convinced, but for them, it will be too late.  The One they have doubted and ignored, will &#8220;take them to task.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Sooner or later everyone will believe in God \u2013 it\u2019s better to be part of the \u201csooner\u201d crowd.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good old Agur Ben Yakeh Proverbs 30: There is no God&#8230;I can do anything I want!
