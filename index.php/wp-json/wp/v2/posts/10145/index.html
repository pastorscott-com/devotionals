Sometimes Christians are viewed with suspicion and other times with contempt. Peter says it\u2019s up to us to correct the mistaken views of our faith. We do that, not by standing up for our rights or debating to prove our point or by withdrawing from society. Instead, we take our spiritual lives out to the streets and let our faith be seen by anyone who cares to look. We treat people well, granting them dignity no matter what their station in life. We treat one another well, refusing to sink to petty infighting over minor differences of opinion. We live as people who reverence God, unashamedly putting our high regard for the Lord on display. Finally, we conduct ourselves as good citizens, not using our citizenship of heaven as an excuse for neglecting our duties as citizens of the country in which we live. The result is that people who don\u2019t know much about our religion will come to respect us. That, in turn, will open the door for us to have a real influence for Jesus. We don\u2019t try to win people by beating them over their heads with our Bibles. Rather, we win them by putting the Jesus we serve on display in our lives every day and in every situation.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: People are drawn to lives that reflect the real Jesus.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Putting Jesus on display 1Peter 2: Treat everyone with dignity.
