Early in the morning he hires a group, promising them a certain wage.  As the day goes on, he continues to add workers with some only working the last hour of the day.  When the workers are paid, all receive the amount promised the workers who first hired on and have worked all day long.  Some of them complain that since they worked longer and harder that they should be paid more.  The answer is that they\u2019re being paid exactly what was agreed when they were hired and it\u2019s no business of theirs what the boss does with his own money.  This, I think, is a picture of God\u2019s grace to us.  I understand that no one is deserving of God\u2019s blessings, but obviously, some are more deserving than others.  However, the Lord wants to bless each and every one.  At the Judgment there will be some who gave their lives to Jesus while they were young and then served the Lord many years.  Others will be there who barely made it in, maybe due to a death bed conversion.  The grace of God will be extended to all who were willing to receive it.  After all, it\u2019s his grace and he can do with it whatever he wants.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The very definition of grace includes the concept that it\u2019s given to the undeserving.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Really, it\u2019s God\u2019s business and not mine Matthew 20: Can\u2019t I do what I want with my own money?
