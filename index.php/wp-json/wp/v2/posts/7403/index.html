Like a desert traveler I can&#8217;t help but to stay for a while and pitch my tent and enjoy the beauty of this place.  Jeremiah has seen all the worst of life and it&#8217;s likely that he won&#8217;t live to see things get much better.  Still, he&#8217;s concluded that &#8220;it&#8217;s a good thing to quietly hope&#8221; in God.  I love the phrase &#8220;quietly hope.&#8221;  I remember praying with an individual once about a legitimate concern in their life.  However, their prayer was loud and emotional to the point that I don&#8217;t think that they managed to get much of a prayer prayed.  Now, let me quickly add that I&#8217;m not against emotional prayers and I don&#8217;t want to go on record as opposing &#8220;loud&#8221; prayers either.  However, the individual I prayed with wasn&#8217;t praying so much as working up some emotional state.  Hopeful trust isn&#8217;t best displayed in a loud, emotional prayer.  To truly hope is to calm down, to look to God, and to place things in his hands.  Jesus warned against praying as though we think God will be impressed by our many words and as I visit this passage, I think Jeremiah&#8217;s making a similar statement.  Without making a lot of noise, without working up our emotions, we turn our faces to heaven in quiet hope in God.  Remember, Jeremiah isn&#8217;t speaking theoretically here; after all, we&#8217;re in the heart of his book of Lamentations.<br \/>\nTake Away: To truly hope is to calm down, to look to God, and to place things in his hands.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Quiet Hope Lamentations 3: It&#8217;s a good thing to quietly hope&#8230;for help from God.
