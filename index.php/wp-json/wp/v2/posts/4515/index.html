First, and reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt many years earlier, there\u2019s a rat infestation in the land. These nasty rodents are showing up everywhere and getting into everything. Second, there\u2019s an outbreak of (ahem) hemorrhoids among the population. Knowing what happened to poor old Dagon, and having heard the story of the plagues of Egypt, the leaders of the cities of the Philistines want to let the Chest of God go even as Pharaoh let the Israelites go. Their priests come up with a plan that includes sending a peace offering along with the Ark. What an offering it is: golden replicas of the rats and (get this) the (politely called) \u201ctumors.\u201d Can\u2019t you imagine the look on the faces of the people of Beth Shemesh when they open the bag containing those replicas! It all sounds weird to us, but from the Philistine\u2019s point of view it\u2019s a desperate effort to make peace with the God of Israel. I think people today still do some strange things in an attempt to get on the good side of God. However, it\u2019s unnecessary. God has already built that bridge and all we have to do is \u201ccross it.\u201d (Get it? \u201cCross\u201d it). No golden rats or tumors are necessary.<br \/>\nTake Away: It doesn\u2019t take golden rats to make peace with God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yuck, yuck, yuck! 1 Samuel 6: Five gold tumors and five gold rats Not only is the Ark causing problems for the Philistine idol Dagon some bad things are happening in their cities and in the very personal lives of their citizens as well.
