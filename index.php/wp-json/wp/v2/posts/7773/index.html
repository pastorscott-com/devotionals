I certainly know I need the Lord\u2019s forgiveness for the many \u201cdebts\u201d of my life.  It makes me a bit uncomfortable to realize that the Lord uses the level of my forgiving attitude toward those indebted to me as his measure of his forgiveness in my life.  In the passage before me today the Lord uses Haggai to deliver a message concerning current events in the lives of the people of his day.  They\u2019ve been stingy in their support for rebuilding the Temple.  Now, the Lord says he\u2019s treating them with that same level of stinginess.  They\u2019re holding back in supporting the rebuilding of the Temple and the Lord\u2019s holding back in his provision of rain for their crops.  I\u2019m glad today for the abundant generosity of God.   His provision in my life greatly exceeds all that I do for him.  Still, there\u2019s a time to be reminded that some of the Lord\u2019s blessings to me are linked to my attitude toward the things that matter to the Lord.  Jesus teaches me to pray, \u201cLord, forgive me to the same extent that I forgive others.\u201d  Today, Haggai adds that I should be able to pray, \u201cLord, care for the needs of my life in the same way I care for the place in which I worship you.\u201d  If that makes me squirm a bit, well, maybe it\u2019s supposed to!<br \/>\nTake Away: Remember that some of the Lord\u2019s blessings to us are linked to our attitude towards the things that matter to him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My attitude toward things that matter to the Lord Haggai 1: I\u2019ve matched your tight-fisted stinginess.
