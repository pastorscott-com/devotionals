However, as the fire burns down to embers, an individual blade of fire may seem to light up the entire campsite for a moment. That\u2019s the feeling I get as I read the story of the waning days of Judah. Most everything\u2019s bad. Kings rise to power and then fall and almost seem to be in a competition to see who can be the most ungodly. However, along the way we meet some courageous men who, almost single handedly, lift the entire nation to their shoulders and craft, at least temporarily, a return to God. Such a man is Josiah. When the word of the Lord is discovered in the Temple he publicly vows to live according to the ancient covenant. He seeks God\u2019s direction and receives it. Because of his desire for God, an entire generation is stopped from the march to destruction that it has been on. As I look at my own society and see the journey we\u2019re on I nearly surrender to despair. We\u2019re so godless, so lost in the darkness of our own making. Still, I\u2019m reminded that even in a dying campfire just one flame can light the night. I pray that the Lord will give such a leader to my generation.<br \/>\nTake Away: Lord, have mercy on us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God-centered leadership 2 Chronicles 35: The king\u2026solemnly committed himself to the covenant.
