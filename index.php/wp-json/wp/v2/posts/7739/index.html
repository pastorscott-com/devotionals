The Lord may intend to use this godless nation in his dealings with Judah but that doesn\u2019t mean its despicable evil will be overlooked. As a series of \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d judgments is being listed, the prophet suddenly has a vision of God. Immediately, the prophet calls for \u201choly silence.\u201d This isn\u2019t the time to preach sermons of condemnation. The only thing a human being can do at this point is to bow in silence before the Lord. This, I think is God\u2019s second answer to Habakkuk. The prophet has asked how a holy God can use a sinful nation to punish Judah. One answer is that God is well aware of the sin of Babylon and that he will decisively deal with it. The other answer is heard as the Almighty reveals himself to Habakkuk. This is similar to what happens in the Book of Job. Job has asked for an audience with God that he might plead his case. However, when God appears, Job is speechless and all he can do is bow in worship and adoration. When I see God my questions are answered. My need is not for the Lord to explain to me everything I think I want to know. The need in my life is a fresh vision of God.<br \/>\nTake Away: All our questions are answered when we genuinely experience the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Questions answered Habakkuk 2: God is in his holy Temple!
