It\u2019s the \u201ccurse\u201d part of the chapter in which God lists all that will happen if they break their promises to God.  Like anyone else, I enjoy the \u201cblessing\u201d section and can happily skip the \u201ccursing\u201d part.  However, there\u2019s more to the chapter than those two elements.  The final section is about God\u2019s faithfulness.  You might say that it\u2019s the best part of all.  God says that even if they utterly fail and if the entire \u201ccurse\u201d comes to pass\u2026even then, he\u2019ll be just a prayer away.  These words are all about grace and mercy and faithfulness.  In this the Lord opens his heart to us.  When it all falls apart because of sin the Lord waits to reestablish the covenant relationship with them.  Here\u2019s a clear view of the Lord as the God of Second Chances.  There\u2019s unbelievable power in the words, \u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d  In spite of failure, in spite of the feeling of a people being utterly rejected \u2013 in spite of it all, God remembers.  I\u2019m thankful, so thankful, that I serve the God of Second Chances.<br \/>\nTake Away: We all need this God of Second Chances in our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The God of Second Chances Leviticus 26: On the other hand, if they confess their sins\u2026I\u2019ll remember my covenant\u2026.
