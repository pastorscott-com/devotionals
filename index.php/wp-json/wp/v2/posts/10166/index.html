First, there are 144,000 people from the family trees of Israel. Then, he sees thousands and thousands from \u201call nations and tribes.\u201d The number is too vast to count and they all begin singing praise to God and to the Lamb. John is transfixed by the scene but his focus is interrupted when one of the Elders asks him a question. He asks John who they are, this white robed, too-vast-to-be-counted throng of worshipers. John doesn\u2019t know, but the Elder answers his own question. These are those who have come through the great tribulation. This huge multitude isn\u2019t made up of everyone in heaven, just of those who faithfully serve Christ right at the end, as earth\u2019s history is being wrapped up. A couple of things come to mind at this point. First, heaven won\u2019t be a lonely place. In spite of \u201cmany called, few chosen\u201d the \u201cfew\u201d comprise a huge number. Second, as bad as the time of tribulation might be, by God\u2019s power his people can overcome, not just surviving, barely limping in, but thriving in numbers too great to count, coming through clean and rejoicing. This is a testimony, not to human perseverance, but to God\u2019s power at work in the lives of his people.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: By the grace of the Lord, by his power in our lives\u2026by the Lord, we can hold fast in our faith and receive a glorious entrance into the place he\u2019s prepared for us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Victory in Jesus Revelation 7: Who are these dressed in white robes, and where did they come from?
