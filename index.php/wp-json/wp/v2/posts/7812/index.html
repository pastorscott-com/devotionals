Jerusalem, that city of peace, is going to be ground zero for a battle to end all battles.  When it appears there\u2019s no hope, God will take over its defense.  He\u2019ll not only destroy the attackers, but he\u2019ll move on the hearts of his people, pouring a \u201cspirit of grace and prayer\u201d over them.  In a moment of clarity, they\u2019ll realize their Messiah came centuries earlier.  They\u2019ll weep as they realize that they rejected him.  They\u2019ll mourn as they remember how his life was taken, a spear thrust to the side being the final act of violence done to his body.  This national act of repentance will result in God\u2019s \u201cwashing away their sins.\u201d  As history winds down Israel will be restored as God\u2019s chosen people.  We Christians, according to the New Testament, have a place in all this.  Paul says we\u2019re like a branch from a wild olive tree that is grafted into the cultured one that has been lovingly cared for by the husbandman.
