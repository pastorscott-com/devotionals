The things he and Jeremiah preached about have come true. Israel and Judah fell to Babylon. Jerusalem, including their beloved Temple, was looted and then leveled. The years pass and men of God like Ezekiel and Daniel take the baton of God\u2019s revelation. As promised, Babylon falls to Persia, led by Cyrus. It&#8217;s then that the curtain lifts on the next stage of God\u2019s promises. Cyrus and later on, Darius, allows the Jews who desire to do so to return to their homeland. Before long, we hear the prophecies of Obadiah, Haggai, and Zechariah and the stories of Nehemiah and Ezra. To some extent all the Minor Prophets have targeted messages. For instance, both Jonah\u2019s and Nahum\u2019s entire stories are focused on God\u2019s intentions for Nineveh. Habakkuk\u2019s work is centered on God\u2019s use of the Babylonians to discipline his people Israel. Haggai\u2019s specialty is the attitude of the returned exiles concerning the rebuilding of the Temple. This prophet is a practical person.
