Nadab lasts for just two years before he\u2019s assassinated and replaced by Baasha. Baasha knows that God rejected Jeroboam and his family because of Jeroboam&#8217;s sin but that doesn&#8217;t stop him from following the same road to ruin. He rules Israel for 24 years but his legacy is his spiritual failure and his leading of Israel farther away from God. We aren&#8217;t surprised when we see God rejecting him and sending word that he\u2019s going to reduce Baasha and his regime to cinders. While I\u2019m a firm believer in free will, I see that God holds Baasha responsible for the sin of all Israel. Leadership has privileges but it also comes with a hefty helping of responsibility. God expects leaders to not only be righteous themselves, but to influence those who follow them to greater righteousness as well. That\u2019s true of pastors and churches, but, as I see here, it\u2019s true for national leaders and their subjects too.<br \/>\nTake Away: Leaders who forget the responsibility side of their position are walking the road to failure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Weight of leadership 1Kings 15: He was openly evil before God, walking in the footsteps of Jeroboam, who both sinned and made Israel sin.
