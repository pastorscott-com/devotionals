Through Zechariah the Lord reminds them that his requirements are unchanged.  He isn&#8217;t very interested in their traditions but he&#8217;s very interested in how they treat one another.  He&#8217;s always called for them to love their neighbors and be compassionate in their dealings with one another.  Also, the Lord still has a special concern for widows, orphans, outsiders, and the poor.   If these Jews want to please the Lord, they&#8217;ll focus on these things more and on their traditions less.  Zechariah goes on to describe how, when their ancestors ignored these things that the Lord became angry with them and scattered them throughout the world.  Is it possible that we spend too much time worrying about doing church properly and too little time pursuing the things the Lord lists here?  When all is said and done, is the Lord more interested in how capably I can do church than he is in how I treat the poor?  This passage ought to serve as a compass for all who consider themselves to be a people of God.   Here we find a description of how God&#8217;s people ought to live.<br \/>\nTake Away: When all is said and done, the Lord is more interested in how we treat others than in how we do church.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s priority list Zechariah 7: The message hasn&#8217;t changed.
