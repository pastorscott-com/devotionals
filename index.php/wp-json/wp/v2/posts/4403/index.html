That\u2019s what the people of Israel discover as God opens the way through the river.  As the thousands cross over, twelve men are given the assignment of each taking one of those stones and piling them on the bank of the river as a memorial of this momentous event.  Then, in future generations, when children ask about the pile of stones, the story will be told.  It is the story of God&#8217;s deliverance; of how God makes a way when there is no way.  It\u2019s a story of God&#8217;s grace, patience, and mercy.  It\u2019s the story of his unfailing love.  Here&#8217;s a tip right from God&#8217;s Word: build some memorials in your life.  Take the kids to the old church, point to the place at the altar and tell them what happened there.  Read to them the scripture that got your attention and tell them why.  Show them your pile of stones from the Jordan riverbed and in so doing pass your story along to the next generation.  Someday, your great-grandchildren, who never met you, will hear their grandpa talk about how his dad came to Christ.  Thus, God&#8217;s grace will minister through your life from beyond your years on earth.<br \/>\nTake Away: Tell your story to those who are the most precious to you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Make a pile of stones Joshua 4: In the days to come, when your children ask their fathers, &#8220;What are these stones doing here?&#8221; tell your children this: &#8220;Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry ground.&#8221; Out in the middle of the Jordan River, way down at the bottom, there are stones.
