Then I turn the page and find myself reading a beautiful, gentle love story. Even in the midst of diminishing worship of God and the resulting lowering of morality in general, I find that God is still working in the lives of those who will walk with him. I see that some people aren&#8217;t absorbed by the common culture. Instead, some are noble and kind and generous even when, because of that, they are totally out of step with their society. This is a wonderful reminder to me as I reflect on my own culture &#8212; a culture that seems committed to remove God from all public life; a culture that &#8220;calls the darkness &#8216;light&#8217; and calls the light &#8216;darkness.&#8217; There\u2019s still the possibility of purity and Christian gentleness, even in my culture. Not only is it possible, but a small, unnoticed act might just impact the world in ways I can never imagine.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even in the midst of a corrupt culture we can live clean, beautiful lives in Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A candle shining in the darkness Ruth 1: It was back in the days when judges led Israel.
