It\u2019s the Messiah who\u2019s clearly before the prophet now.  What he sees amazes him.  He knows God is showing him the promised Savior but in this vision the Savior looks nothing like anyone thinks he should look.  The Man he sees writhes in agony and suffers a horrible death.

Even with that knowledge, the Messiah will be sent to save us, not by crushing our enemies, but by allowing himself to be crushed.  The words of Mark Lowry&#8217;s Christmas classic echo the words of Isaiah, &#8220;this is such a strange way to save the world.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Christ conquers sin, not by crushing enemies, but by being crushed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A strange way to save the world Isaiah 53: Who would have thought God&#8217;s saving power would look like this?
