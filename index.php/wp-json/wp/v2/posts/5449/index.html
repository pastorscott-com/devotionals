The disaster didn&#8217;t come because he changed the rules or backed out of his promises to them.  It\u2019s their doing.  Because of that, the road back, as it does for the prodigal son, starts with their coming to their senses and acknowledging their sin.  There&#8217;s hope here, because there is, indeed, a way back; the possibility of restoration even after sin.  It starts with admitting, &#8220;I&#8217;m a sinner.&#8221;  If I think I\u2019ll return to God on my terms I\u2019m only fooling myself.  In this passage the Lord proclaims, &#8220;I\u2019m as powerful as ever.&#8221;  Things don&#8217;t have to stay the same because God has the power to make things right.  It&#8217;s a long road home for these who\u2019ve been exiled to distant lands and that road starts with their repentance.  That&#8217;s true for them, it\u2019s true for the prodigal, and it&#8217;s true for me when my sins have separated me from God.<br \/>\nTake Away: Things don&#8217;t have to stay the same because he Lord has the power to make things right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The journey home begins with this first step Isaiah 50: It&#8217;s your sins that put you here, your wrongs that got you shipped out.
