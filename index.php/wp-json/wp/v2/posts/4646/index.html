With the skill of a big business publicist he orchestrates things to make it appear that the public and the leaders of Israel have made him king. Earlier, David could have easily stopped all this. In fact, he could have kept Absalom in exile in the first place. Instead, David has believed the best in Absalom and turned a blind eye to his scheming. When word of the power grab reaches David he immediately retreats, believing that Absalom has the upper hand. It\u2019s as he flees Jerusalem that we hear the pledge Ittai makes to David. Ittai is from the city of Gath, which means he\u2019s a Philistine. Apparently, he\u2019s deserted his native land to follow David. When David sees him he tells him to go home to Gath, but Ittai will have none of it. He\u2019s committed to David and pledges to follow him even to death. This warrior&#8217;s words to David shine in the darkness of an otherwise bleak day. In a spiritual view of things, I am a Philistine, an outsider in the family of God. Like Ittai, the King, himself, has made me welcome. And like Ittai, I cast my lot with my King, all the way, life or death.<br \/>\nTake Away: What an honor it is for an outsider to be invited to the inside by none other than the King, himself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Outsiders and insiders 2 Samuel 15: Where my master is, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be &#8212; whether it means life or death.
