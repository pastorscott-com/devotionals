They\u2019ve arrived in his European city and made friends with some of the nicest people in town.  They like to talk religion and have some unusual ideas, but talking religion and having unusual ideas isn\u2019t especially uncommon or damning.  Still, their growing popularity gets the attention of some people who stand for the status quo and some more powerful people in town have decided enough is enough.  To teach these outsiders a lesson they\u2019ve been beaten and thrown in jail for the night.  Once they\u2019re released they\u2019ll waste no time getting out of town, that\u2019s for sure.  Now, bloody and bruised they\u2019re chained up like common criminals.  Their behavior, though, isn\u2019t like criminals or even people who\u2019ve been beaten up.  They\u2019re singing!  The jailer thinks these nice men are probably crazy.  Still, there\u2019s something about them that disturbs him to the core.  Who is this Jesus they sing about anyway?  Suddenly, an earthquake shakes the neighborhood.  The jailer runs to the gate of the jail to find it open, swinging on it hinges.

To save himself the public execution he prepares to kill himself and is about to fall on his sword when Paul cries out for him to stop, they\u2019re still there.  There\u2019s a second earthquake, this time in the man\u2019s heart.  Whatever it is that these two singing prisoners have is what he wants.
