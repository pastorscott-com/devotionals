If nothing else, God would at least explain to Job what it is he\u2019s done to deserve these horrible things. Now Job\u2019s getting what he asked for. The Lord has shown up. The thing is God isn&#8217;t defensive in the least and he isn&#8217;t especially interested in explaining things to Job. Through these tragic events Job has held in there. He\u2019s remained faithful to the Lord, refusing to &#8220;curse God and die&#8221; even when he\u2019s no longer being blessed in his faithfulness and righteousness. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Job is 100% correct in what he thinks about all this. Several times he\u2019s said things that are wrong. When God shows up he first concentrates on these things. He says to Job, not &#8220;I have some answers for you&#8221; but, instead, &#8220;I have some questions for you.&#8221; Then, God begins to remind Job of Who He is and who Job is. This is a humbling experience but Job will never get a handle on many of the questions he\u2019s asked without this. That\u2019s how it is for us too. We sing, &#8220;What a friend we have in Jesus&#8221; and that\u2019s a wonderful truth. Still, it has to be balanced against who God is. His awesome power in Creation, his holiness, and his nature in general must humble us even when we\u2019re struggling with issues in life. When God begins to move in Job&#8217;s life again, his first move is to bring Job back to these truths.<br \/>\nTake Away: Remembering who God is is the first step to understanding many of the questions of life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now who\u2019s on the spot?
