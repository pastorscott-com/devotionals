He is, at the same time fully God and fully man.  As he goes about his ministry he does so as man.  Here\u2019s humanity as the Lord intended.  Jesus trusts and obeys his Father implicitly.  He performs miracles, not by drawing from his power and authority as God, but as a man who relies on his Heavenly Father and is thus empowered to do miracles.  Then, we arrive at the Mount of Transfiguration.  For a short time it\u2019s God in this God-man who&#8217;s evident.  There\u2019s light such as the disciples have never seen.  Then, there\u2019s fellowship with two spiritual giants of the past, Moses and Elijah.  The Lord God in the person of Jesus discusses the coming events in Jerusalem with two great men of the past.  I\u2019m not saying I understand all that\u2019s going on here.  Still, it\u2019s my feeling that throughout most of our Lord\u2019s ministry I see, in Jesus, humanity as was intended at Creation.  In this case though, I see God breaking through in such a way that skin and bones can hardly contain him.  The disciples experiencing this are speechless.  Now, more than 2000 years later I read of this event and struggle to find words to describe what I see happening.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away:  The Jesus I see on the Mount of Transfiguration is the same Jesus he always is, but here, I see him in a way I haven\u2019t seen him before.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The other view of Jesus Luke 9: The appearance of his face changed and his clothes became blinding white.
