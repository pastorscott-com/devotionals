The work of the Messiah isn\u2019t only to provide salvation to the people of Israel, but to bring, in his words, &#8220;global salvation.&#8221;  Of course, that\u2019s good news for me, since I&#8217;m on the &#8220;global&#8221; side of the equation.  Isaiah envisions some of his fellow Israelites looking at their current situation and thinking that God has forgotten them.  Their lives are anything but glorious and, while they want to hear this good news, they can&#8217;t get their hearts around it.  To them, Isaiah says, &#8220;Can a mother forget her own child?  God has been Father and Mother to us and he hasn&#8217;t forgotten us.&#8221;  Israel has messed up in every way and her sin has had real, and painful, consequences.  In the darkness of those consequences she feels forsaken and forgotten.  But it isn&#8217;t so.  God reaches out to them with the compassion of a mother nursing her infant.  Israel isn&#8217;t the only one who\u2019s messed up.  The world is filled with people who\u2019ve had far more failures than successes in their moral lives.  Does this describe you?  If so, the message of this passage isn&#8217;t just for ancient Israelites; it&#8217;s God&#8217;s word to you, today.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord reaches out to us with the compassion of a mother reaching out for her infant child.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Global Salvation Isaiah 49: Even if mothers forget, I&#8217;d never forget you &#8212; never.
