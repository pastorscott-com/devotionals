The tamer version of it is that, with the storm knocking out all power, people dig into their freezers and have a feast of all the ice cream, etc. that won&#8217;t survive the power outage.  A few years ago, when we fled a hurricane supposedly aimed for our area we took steaks we\u2019d been saving and had a big cookout as we awaited the bad weather.  We might as well enjoy the food; otherwise it\u2019ll be lost when the electricity goes off.  I wonder if that\u2019s the thinking in this portion of Isaiah.  The nation is in trouble, and no victory has been won, but Isaiah complains about the party atmosphere he sees.  Apparently, someone has told him to lighten up, that things will be all right.  His response is that things aren&#8217;t going to be all right.  They live in a doomed nation and everything\u2019s about to fall apart.  Sometimes our message to our society isn\u2019t the message it wants to hear.  Sometimes, it isn&#8217;t going to be all right.  In fact, when we look at things from the largest point of view we know that the world isn&#8217;t going to just go on and on as it is.  A day\u2019s coming with everything we know is going to melt away.  While we can&#8217;t just live there, in doom and gloom, we Christians need to take a good look at the people around us.  Outside of Christ, to use Isaiah&#8217;s words, &#8220;these people are doomed.&#8221;  Ours is a message of hope, but it\u2019s also the only hope of a world that\u2019s doomed.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our message is one of hope, but we need to remember it\u2019s the only hope of an otherwise doomed humanity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Preaching a message people don\u2019t want to hear Isaiah 22: Don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s going to be all right.
