God is at work even as Sennacherib issues his threat against Judah. Things are going to be okay because God says they\u2019ll be okay. Soon thereafter Sennacherib has to turn his attention to another battle line, but before doing so, he sends Hezekiah another message which is intended to scare him witless. Whether it succeeds in scaring him or not, I do not know, but it certainly gets his attention. Rather than running and hiding, Hezekiah goes to prayer. Taking the letter from the King of Assyria to the Temple he spreads it out before God and begins pouring his heart out to the Lord. The answer comes sooner and not later. A messenger arrives from Isaiah with word that God has heard his plea, and that God has an answer for Sennacherib; an answer that should scare him witless! Well, this all makes for good biblical drama; fine devotional reading from which I can glean lessons to apply to my life. However, today I\u2019m reminded that on this day so long ago this isn&#8217;t just a story from out of a Book as far as Hezekiah is concerned. There\u2019s a real and powerful enemy who intends to kill him and massacre his people. When I see him going to pray I see a man desperate beyond words, and when I hear God answer him through Isaiah, I know that the story isn&#8217;t all wrapped up with a neat bow at that point. Now that Hezekiah is hearing from God he must do what may be the hardest part of all: he must believe. It\u2019s one thing to read stuff like this in the Old Testament but another to see it really work in our lives. What do I do when a sad doctor is saying that there\u2019s nothing else to be done, yet some uncertain messenger from God is saying otherwise? Even when I want to believe it isn&#8217;t all that easy. Hezekiah cries out to God and God answers. The rest of the story is that, when God answers, Hezekiah believes.<br \/>\nTake Away: Believing takes effort and is an act of the will. We choose to believe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What to do after God answers 2Kings 19: And Hezekiah prayed &#8212; oh, how he prayed!
