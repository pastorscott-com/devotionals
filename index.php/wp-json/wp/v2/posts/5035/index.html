It sounds crazy to us, but in that kingdom Xerxes is treated like a god. Even his own queen can come into his presence only when summoned. If she or anyone else breaks that rule they can be put to death. However, the king, himself, can grant a sort of &#8220;instant reprieve&#8221; if he wants to simply by extending his scepter to the uninvited person. Xerxes is just a man, and, apparently, a rather insecure one at that, but that&#8217;s how it is in his kingdom. Esther tells Mordecai that she hasn&#8217;t been summoned by the king for more than a month, and, in light of what happened to the previous queen when she didn&#8217;t come when summoned, Esther is taking a real risk here. However, it\u2019s a necessary one. If Xerxes is unworthy of such deference, there is a King who is King of kings who is worthy of all that and more. However, his relationship to me is so much better than that of Xerxes to his subjects. In fact, I have a standing invitation to come into his Presence any time. This King extended the scepter to me and everyone else long ago, declaring his throne room open for all who will come.<br \/>\nTake Away: We have a standing invitation to enter the throne room, let\u2019s take advantage of it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The extended scepter Esther 5: He was pleased to see her, the king extended the gold scepter in his hand.
