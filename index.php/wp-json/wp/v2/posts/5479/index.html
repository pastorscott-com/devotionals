The common wisdom is that a person will say whatever they need to say to get elected.  Hopefully, that isn&#8217;t always the case.  A nation needs leaders who lead with integrity.  Still, it isn&#8217;t hard for anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to remember broken promises from vote seekers.  Isaiah says that God has things to say and that the Lord doesn\u2019t hesitate to make some promises.  God&#8217;s message isn\u2019t the common message of the world.  After all, his ways are higher than our ways.  Not only is his message unique, but his faithfulness to make good on that message is unique too.  When God says I\u2019m to live my life his way and that, if I do, I\u2019ll have a better life, well, that&#8217;s a word I can take to the bank.  The Lord\u2019s at work, building a people worthy of being called his people.  Even as rain falling from the sky is instrumental in producing bountiful crops, so does the Word of God produce good lives in those who hear and obey.  The message of this scripture is that God isn&#8217;t just making so much noise when he says &#8220;this is the way I want you to live.&#8221;  Rather, he\u2019s giving me an approach to life that will produce the rich harvest of God&#8217;s blessings.<br \/>\nTake Away: The way of the Lord is the best way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s more than a chicken in every pot Isaiah 55: So will the words that come out of my mouth not come back empty-handed.
