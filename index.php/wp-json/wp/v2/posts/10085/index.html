While it was okay for Jewish Christians to continue to observe the Jewish rules and regulations the burden of keeping those rules wouldn\u2019t be placed on the Gentile believers. That was a very big deal, but it wasn\u2019t the end of the subject. Some of the \u201crule keeping\u201d Jewish Christians refused to accept that decision. Off they went to the Gentile churches to \u201cre-educate\u201d the new Christians. Their brand of Christianity was quite Jewish. Beyond that, even Jewish believers like Peter tended to walk on both sides of the road on this one. Around Jews they were very Jewish, but when they were with non-Jews, they relaxed and conducted themselves as though it is, indeed, faith in Jesus that alone makes a person right with God. Paul and Peter had a bit of a falling out about it when Peter, who had been getting along just fine with the Gentile Christians, quietly withdrew from them when a group of rule keeping Jewish Christians showed up. Clearly, in spite of the fact that there had been an official ruling on the matter, in practice, things were still up in the air. Paul, in this case, doesn\u2019t appeal to the Jerusalem ruling, but, instead goes straight to the cross of Christ. He reminds his readers that if rules did the job, then the Jews, of all people, would be happily satisfied with their situation. He also tells them, that, if that was possible, then Jesus would have never gone to the cross. After all, his message to us isn\u2019t \u201ctry harder and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Rather, his message is that he is the \u201cway, the truth, and the life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Even if we somehow managed to keep all the rules we\u2019d still be unsaved outside of Christ.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rules and regs Galatians 2: If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.
