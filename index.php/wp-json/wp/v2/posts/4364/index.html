Moses, though, has his own take on &#8220;health and wealth.&#8221;  In this passage he carefully lists the route to the &#8220;good life.&#8221;  It\u2019s all centered on doing what God expects.  What does he expect?<br \/>\n1.\t&#8220;Live in his presence in holy reverence&#8221;<br \/>\n2.\t&#8220;Follow the road he sets out for you&#8221;<br \/>\n3.\t&#8220;Love\u2026and serve&#8221; him &#8220;with everything you have in you&#8221;<br \/>\n4.\t&#8220;Obey the commandments and regulations of God&#8221;<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s not about me taking advantage of some spiritual principle for my benefit or my tapping into some hidden potential within myself.  It has nothing to do with driving off the spirit of poverty or illness.   It sure isn&#8217;t about me manipulating God to get him to do nice things for me.  When I align myself with God&#8217;s expectations my life is a good life.  That goodness, by the way, may not be seen in temporary things like health or wealth but, instead, in my living a truly blessed life, pleasing to God.  The path to the good life is summed up in four words: live, follow, love, and obey.<br \/>\nTake Away: Many spiritual \u201csecrets\u201d are hidden in plain sight.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The path to the good life Deuteronomy 10: \u2026live a good life.
