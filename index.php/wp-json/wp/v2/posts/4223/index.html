You know this people and how set on evil they are.\u201d<br \/>\nAaron is left in charge while Moses is up on the mountain meeting with God.  Just as the Lord said, there\u2019s an idol-centered orgy going on.  Moses demands an explanation from his brother who responds that these people are just bad people and there\u2019s nothing he can do.  Aaron is supposed to be the leader here, but he\u2019s a spectacular failure.  Leaders must have vision and be skilled in organizing and persuading people to work toward the fulfillment of that vision.  Aaron\u2019s view of leadership is to help the people do what they want to do already.  His excuse to Moses is, \u201cthat\u2019s just how these people are.\u201d  His error is huge and because of it he fails his people, Moses, and God.  Genuine leaders don\u2019t wring their hands as people do the wrong thing.  Neither is it testing the political winds and \u201cleading\u201d the people to do what they already want to do, right or wrong.  In fact, leadership can be lonely and occasionally it is practically suicidal.  Aaron should have stood for God\u2019s way even if it meant that the people just ran over him to do what they wanted in the first place.  Moses understands leadership.  He takes a position away from the goings on and calls for those who are on God\u2019s side to join him.  He\u2019s going to make things right no matter what the cost.  That\u2019s leadership.<br \/>\nTake Away: Leadership is more than helping people do what they would do anyway.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lesson on leadership Exodus 32: Moses said to Aaron, \u201cWhat on Earth did these people ever do to you that you involved them in this huge sin?\u201d Aaron said, \u201cMaster, don\u2019t be angry.
