In this passage he says he cries &#8220;day and night&#8221; over their sin and the resulting destruction it will bring to them.  He\u2019s shocked and dismayed by all he sees: so much pain and suffering, so much sin and evil.  Now, another thing shocks him.  It&#8217;s the reaction of the church people to all this.  He expects at least for them to share in his tears over it all.  However, it isn&#8217;t that way.  Church services go on as usual.  &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that an interesting illustration the pastor used in the sermon?&#8221;  &#8220;Yes, but he preached a bit long for my taste, however, that special in song was lovely, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;  Off we all go to our favorite restaurant for lunch, hopefully, we&#8217;ll get there before the Baptists.  Oh, I&#8217;m not really against good church services or Christians enjoying fellowship after the service.  However, Jeremiah&#8217;s heartbreak over lost people does speak to my heart today.  We&#8217;ve got to stop doing business as usual and find ways to impact our society for Christ.  Our church growth model is often more about getting people to switch to our church than it is about seeing people saved.  We simply can&#8217;t think we&#8217;re doing what the Lord commanded us to do by just having good worship services while so many are headed out to eternity without Jesus.<br \/>\nTake Away: We&#8217;ve got to stop doing business as usual and find ways to impact our society for Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The harsh reality Jeremiah 14: Preachers and priest going about their business as if nothing&#8217;s happened!
