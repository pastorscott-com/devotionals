Would that God would put his Spirit on all of them.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s more going on in Numbers 11 than just Moses needing to organize with some key leaders. God intends to take some of the Spirit he\u2019s given Moses and divide it up among those chosen to assist him.  When seventy leaders are gathered to initiate this new approach something spiritual happens, and, in ways that cause us to think of the unique events on the Day of Pentecost, there are outward signs of this spiritual event.  A couple of the chosen leaders miss the meeting and out there in the camp they too publicly prophesy.  It\u2019s this public display that concerns some.  When word is brought to Moses he\u2019s undisturbed.  It\u2019s okay with him for God to place his Spirit on them even though they missed the meeting.  In fact, he wishes all God\u2019s people were endowed for service.  Here I see that beyond all the articles in \u201cLeadership Magazine\u201d and beyond all the good advice in \u201cSeven Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d, and beyond all the important leadership lessons to be learned is the fact that God gifts people for leadership.  Leadership in the Kingdom is first, a spiritual act.  Pastors and other church leaders must never forget that.  Our authority is based on God putting his Spirit in us.<br \/>\nTake Away: Training is important but beyond that is the truth that God gifts some people for leadership.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first thing about spiritual leadership Numbers 11: Would that all God\u2019s people were prophets.
