He\u2019s compassionate in taking his niece in and raising her after she\u2019s orphaned. Clearly, he has a godly influence on her as this story shows. Mordecai doesn&#8217;t want the spotlight but he\u2019s reluctantly brought into it by the unexpected circumstances that are revealed in the book of Esther. He stands up to the powerful Haman and shows himself to be a loyal subject to Xerxes. Mordecai is one of those people who quietly goes about living for God for many years, and then, at just the right time is used by God in some very specific, positive way. Mordecai does the right thing when the spotlight of history is turned upon him because he\u2019s been doing the right thing all along.<br \/>\nTake Away: Do the right thing in the everyday events of life and it will be easier to do the right thing when the pressure is on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just doing the right thing Esther 2: Now there was a Jew who lived in the palace complex in Susa.
