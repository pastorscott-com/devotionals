I think these guys get a bad rap from most people.  The first three, at least, are friends of Job and when they arrive and see the pitiful shape he\u2019s in they\u2019re shocked, speechless and broken hearted.  They can hardly bear seeing their friend like this.  When they do speak, they do so in response to Job&#8217;s complaint and the things they say are the same sort of things Job might have said to them had their places been reversed.  The debate that follows isn\u2019t based on Job believing one thing and them believing another.  Instead it\u2019s about Job&#8217;s insistence that things aren\u2019t working as he and his friends always believed they worked.  They say, &#8220;Bad things don&#8217;t happen to good people, therefore, as surprising as it is, Job must be a bad person.&#8221;   Job says, &#8220;I agree that bad things don&#8217;t happen to good people, but I\u2019ve remained faithful to God and bad things have happened to me.  Therefore, God isn&#8217;t following the rules.&#8221;  The thing about Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar that needs to catch our attention is that they say all the same things we\u2019ve said at one time or another.<br \/>\nTake Away: Do we trust God even when we don&#8217;t understand him?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Enter the friends Job 2: They went together to Job to keep him company and comfort him.
