We know all about them, right?  I\u2019m kidding, these two men are lost deep in the pages of our Old Testaments and only the finest of Sunday School scholars knows who they are.  Really, that\u2019s too bad because today pastors of small and medium sized churches owe a lot to modern day Bazael\u2019s and Oholiab\u2019s.  You see, Moses is receiving lots of complicated construction projects from the Lord, but, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s not a blueprint in sight.  The Lord tells Moses to just take note of what he\u2019s being told but not to worry about the actual construction because there are two men down at the foot of the mountain that have been filled with the Spirit.  The result of that filling is not that they&#8217;ll be preachers or prophets or singers.  They are Spirit-filled craftsmen.  All Moses has to do is give them the instructions he\u2019s receiving from the Lord and they\u2019ll take it from there.  I firmly believe that the Spirit still empowers craftsmen (and women) for the hands-on needs of the church.  For instance, when we have a church dinner, I\u2019ve learned to stay out of the way as several women in the congregation are gifted at planning and executing church dinners.  A while back someone came up with the idea of removing all the concrete sidewalks of our church building and replacing them with beautiful paving bricks.  You can take all I know about stuff like that and put it in a thimble but they took that project on.  I helped where I could, mainly as a \u201cbrick carrier.\u201d  Both men and women went to work on that big project and it came as no surprise to me that some of those folks knew how to do it.  They handled everything from preparing the ground to knowing how to create a pleasing pattern in the bricks.  In the church we tend to lift great speakers and singers but, I fear, fail to recognize the Spirit powered hands-on people.  Thank God for sons and daughters of Bezael and Oholiab.<br \/>\nTake Away: There are many gifts for service, all of value to God and his people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sons and daughters of Bezael and Oholiab Exodus 31: I\u2019ve personally chosen Bezael son of Uri&#8230;I\u2019ve filled him with the Spirit of God.
