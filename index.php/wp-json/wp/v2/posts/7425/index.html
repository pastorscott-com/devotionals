Ezekiel isn&#8217;t an easy going guy; he&#8217;s a rugged, no-holds-barred kind of preacher who makes us think of Elijah or maybe John the Baptist.  This prophet does weird stuff and then preaches hard, crushing sermons.  In one sermon he describes the end of business as usual for those who&#8217;ve turned their backs on God.  He says that the day&#8217;s coming when people will toss their money aside because it will be meaningless and useless.  I&#8217;m reminded of the last power outage we had in our neighborhood.  Somewhere a breaker had thrown and every household in our area was without electricity.  I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at myself when, for a fleeting moment, I thought, &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t do my work; I guess I&#8217;ll watch some TV till the power comes back on!&#8221;  It took me a nanosecond to realize how silly that thought was.  Without electricity that nice TV was nothing but a big paperweight!  Today, as I consider Ezekiel&#8217;s warning that the money they think is so important is going to be simply thrown away as so much rubbish I&#8217;m reminded that a day&#8217;s coming when all the &#8220;stuff&#8221; I tend to think matters will be just another piece of trash.  I&#8217;ve got to keep that in mind and discipline myself to major on the majors while minoring on the minors of life!<br \/>\nTake Away: All the \u201cstuff\u201d we have will, ultimately, be worthless \u2013 so, invest in that which matters in the long run.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No more business as usual Ezekiel 7: They throw their money into the gutters.
