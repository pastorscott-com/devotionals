This message reshapes the world and eternity.  The horrible death of Jesus on the cross wasn\u2019t a meaningless act of inhumanity.  The resurrection transforms that awful event into the greatest good ever done.  Rather than it being just another example of the inhumanity of humans it becomes the watershed event of history.  The angel nails it all with \u201cHe\u2019s been raised up; he\u2019s here no longer.\u201d  Today, this event is both old and new.  It\u2019s old because it\u2019s the old story I know so well.  It\u2019s new because, right now, even as I type these words, it\u2019s real to me.  My life \u2013 my forever \u2013 is changed because of it.  The resurrection transforms the crucifixion and the crucifixion is the instrument used to transform me.  And it\u2019s all summed up with: \u201cHe\u2019s been raised up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: My hope is founded in the resurrection of Jesus.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the tomb Mark 16: He\u2019s been raised up; he\u2019s here no longer.
