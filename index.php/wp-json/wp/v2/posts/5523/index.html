His nation is caught in the middle of it all.  They\u2019re small players caught between giants and have only one hope of survival: the supernatural.  Only God can save them from the disaster that\u2019s marching relentlessly through history toward them.  The problem is that his people take God for granted.  After all, God gave their forefathers that land saying it was theirs forever.  They\u2019ve concluded that they don&#8217;t have to do anything to remain under the protection of God.  In fact, they don\u2019t even have to live God&#8217;s way.  Jeremiah is given the task of telling them that they have it all wrong and that God can never be taken for granted.  This message isn&#8217;t preached just once, but repeatedly and in various forms.  Sadly, we know that his message is rejected and Jerusalem falls in 587 B.C.  Since I live in days of unrest and amazing change, and since my nation seems to take a lot for granted, I&#8217;m going to read Jeremiah as not only a historical figure, but as a man who just might have something to say to my society too.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord must never be taken for granted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taking too much for granted Jeremiah 1: The Message of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah&#8230;this is what the Lord said.
