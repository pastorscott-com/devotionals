Micah asks the rhetorical question: \u201cHow can I&#8230;show proper respect to the high God?\u201d  He wonders if bigger offerings will do it: lots of rams and barrels of oil.  He wonders if following the practice of the pagans and offering his child as a sacrifice will satisfy the Lord.  Having asked the question he then states the answer.  God has already made his desires for the human race abundantly clear.  Micah says, \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple: Do what is fair and just to your neighbor, be compassionate and loyal in your love, and don\u2019t take yourself too seriously \u2013 take God seriously.\u201d  Micah\u2019s insight into God\u2019s purposes for people is breathtaking.  Some have called this the \u201cJohn 3:16\u201d of the Old Testament.  I do well to take this dusty old statement of God\u2019s purpose for humanity and use it as a guide to my life.  How am I doing on the \u201cfair and just, compassionate and love\u201d standard set here?  Do I have a handle on not taking myself too seriously while taking God very seriously?  There\u2019s nothing in the Bible any more \u201ccontemporary\u201d than this statement.<br \/>\nTake Away: Am I living up to the standard of the Lord?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What God expects of us Micah 6: He\u2019s already made it plain how to live, what to do.
