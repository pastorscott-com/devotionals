Hosea married a prostitute, they had children, but she left him to return to her previous life.  That sounds pretty cut and dried but I don&#8217;t think it was that way at all.  What started off as Hosea&#8217;s obedience to a surprising command of God became a series of intense emotional experiences for the prophet.  Without choosing to, Hosea fell in love and for a time it seemed things were going to work out.  His wife, however, had a hard time settling down into a family routine.  The day came when she turned her back on her husband and children to return to her previous life.  Hosea&#8217;s heart was broken.  Sadly, I know too many people who can identify with the story of broken promises and marriages.  No one walks away unscarred by such a tragedy.  Hosea, trying to cope, throws himself into his work.  That helps him cover the pain.  One day at a time, he begins to get over it.  If the Lord&#8217;s first communication was surprising, his second must have left Hosea in shock.  God tells him to love her again.  That must have seemed like an impossible command.  In the time since their divorce Hosea has carefully crafted a shell about himself, insulating him from the pain she&#8217;s caused even as he hears what she&#8217;s returned to.  Now, God says Hosea is to emerge from that shell and open himself up to her again; not because she&#8217;s reformed, she hasn&#8217;t, but to reflect what God has done in his relationship with humanity.  Hosea&#8217;s wife will get another chance, not because she deserves it, but because Hosea loves her too much to give up on her.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord loves us and reaches out to us even though we don\u2019t deserve it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The second time around Hosea 3: God ordered me, &#8220;Start all over: Love your wife again.&#8221; It isn&#8217;t hard to read between the lines here.
