Some children mock Elisha, the man of God, so he curses them resulting in two bears coming out of the woods and killing 42 of them. What\u2019s this all about anyway? Some Bible scholars I&#8217;ve read say that &#8220;children&#8221; is not the only meaning of the Hebrew word used. It can mean &#8220;servants&#8221; and can refer, not to 7-year-olds, but to young people and even young adults. However, reading that a group of 20-year-old servants mock Elisha and he curses them doesn\u2019t do much to solve my discomfort with this incident. So what do I do with this passage? I think I have to just read it and go on, believing that there\u2019s something happening here that I don&#8217;t get. I have to conclude that I\u2019m missing some vital bit of information that would help me make sense of the passage. It isn&#8217;t unusual to have to deal with life issues that way. For instance, someone tells me that a person for whom I have great respect has done something totally out of character. I can&#8217;t defend what they\u2019ve done but I can conclude that I don&#8217;t know the whole story. Perhaps, if I did, it would make sense to me. So, as I come to this passage I read something that doesn&#8217;t fit in with what I know about God: that &#8220;God is love,&#8221; holy and righteous. I can&#8217;t explain it, but instead of making me doubt God, it just reminds me that I don&#8217;t know the whole story about this or about another million or so issues of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes I have to admit I don\u2019t understand things and rely on the character of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Better think twice before mocking bald men 2Kings 2: Elisha turned, took one look at them, and cursed them.
