As he and his disciples begin their journey to Jerusalem he tells them what\u2019s coming, the bad and the good.  When James and John ask for favored positions in his kingdom, Jesus tells them that they don\u2019t know what they&#8217;re asking.  Very soon, being on his right and left won\u2019t be very desirable places to be.  He again directs them down the servant path as the route to greatness.  Being the slave of others is the Christian route to leadership and Jesus is about to demonstrate that in a most unexpected way.  He\u2019s going to die, not only that we might be set free from the death penalty, but so that we might learn from him to, ourselves, die.  This lesson isn\u2019t only hard to learn, it\u2019s also unwelcome.  Most of us live our lives trying to get things our own way.  When we somehow achieve position one of the perks is that we can now call the shots to suit ourselves.  It is human nature to view everything from the \u201cme\u201d point of view.  Jesus turns this self-centered world upside down.  He says that in his Kingdom, those in power serve with the needs of others uppermost in their minds.  Frankly, after 2000 years you\u2019d think Christians would have a better grasp on this.  Frankly, after being a Christian most of my life, I\u2019d think I\u2019d have a better grasp on it.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Jesus gave his all to, in part, show us how to give our all.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Me first Mark 10: He came to serve, not to be served.
