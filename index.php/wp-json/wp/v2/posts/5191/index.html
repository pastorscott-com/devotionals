It&#8217;s another of those songs sung by the pilgrims as they make their way up to Jerusalem to worship at the Temple.  The topic of this short chorus is &#8220;unity.&#8221;  I can just imagine a family making their way to Jerusalem to worship.  Maybe the kids are a little tired and irritable and start picking on one another.  Mom and dad start singing this song about getting along!  Not only that, but as they journey to Jerusalem the pilgrims anticipate not only worship, but the deep fellowship they will enjoy with their fellow worshipers.  They\u2019ve come from the four corners of their country to worship together and that\u2019s a beautiful thing.  In this dry, arid land, the imagery of the first High Priest, Aaron, being anointed with and overabundance of oil sounds refreshing to them, so they use that image and the picture of abundant dew falling on the parched ground to describe the refreshment they feel in their souls as they join God&#8217;s people in worship.  As we go through our weeks, dealing with everything life throws at us, we too anticipate the time we have with our brothers and sisters in Christ.  That, too, is refreshing to our souls.<br \/>\nTake Away: it\u2019s a beautiful thing when God\u2019s people get together in harmony.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can\u2019t we all just get along?
