The years have not taken their toll because the Lord has intervened, overriding the aging process.  Now, though, the time has come for Moses to die.  Under God\u2019s direction this 120 year old man sets out alone to climb a mountain.  From the peak he looks across into the Promised Land.  He will never set foot there but he knows his people will.  Then Moses dies leaving a legacy of superlatives.  The only one at his funeral is the same God who met him alone at the burning bush eighty years earlier.  From first to last it\u2019s been God and Moses.  I\u2019m a bit sad that after giving his life to the project that Moses doesn\u2019t get to lead the Israelites across Jordan.  However, it\u2019s hard to be too sorry about it.  After all, he lived long and well.  He walked with God and knew his Maker face-to-face.  At the end of his long journey, the Lord, himself, lays him to rest.  I can only hope that, with the more spectacular elements stripped away, something remotely similar can be said when the final lines of my life are written.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s something beautiful about the passing of one of God\u2019s choice people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The funeral was poorly attended Deuteronomy 34: No prophet has risen since in Israel like Moses, whom God knew face-to-face.
