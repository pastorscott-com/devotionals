The town goes wild and before they know it Barnabas and Paul are identified as the Greek gods Zeus and Hermes.  In the mythology of the day Hermes is the spokesman of the gods and since Paul does most of the talking they identify him as Hermes.  Barnabas, though, gets the highest title.  Maybe there\u2019s a lesson here that if we keep our mouths shut people will think more of us than they would otherwise!  Anyway, it takes some doing to calm the crowd down so that Paul can preach the Good News of the gospel to them.  Since the theme of the day is already set, Paul focuses in on the true God and his good will toward all people.  That good will, he says, is evident in the blessings that surround each of us.  Here\u2019s evangelism fueled by Creation.  Even a person who\u2019s secular to the core looks at the majesty of the Grand Canyon or some other natural wonder and feels a sense of gratitude.  A good place to start a conversation about the Lord is to tell them who it is that we thank for it all.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: One of the ways the Lord has revealed himself to us is through his Creation.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Telling thankful people just who to thank Acts 14: We don\u2019t make God; he makes us, and all of this.
