At least I think he\u2019s describing a vision he had.  His wording moves to third person, but the setting of the passage concerns visions and revelations given him by the Lord.  Paul was lifted up into heaven and there heard things he was forbidden to share with others.  The Apostle says that if he wanted to he could focus on such experiences and trump about anyone.  Instead, though, he chooses to focus on his humiliations and, in fact has found his most troubling, humbling handicap (although he doesn\u2019t tell us what it is) to be yet another great blessing.  This handicap serves two good purposes in his life.  On one hand it balances out the ecstasies he experienced in Christ, keeping him firmly grounded in the here and now.  On the other hand, his weaknesses drive him to even greater dependency on the Lord.  As he relies on the Lord rather than on his own experiences, as deeply spiritual as they might be, he finds strength.  Blessings are, well, a blessing!  However, they can also be a curse.  If I think the Lord has made me a favorite because of some deep spiritual experience that experience can actually serve as a stumbling block in my life.  Of course, the Lord knows this.  I think he sometimes withholds some special intimacy from us for our own good.  At other times, as it is in Paul\u2019s case, the Lord works in our lives in wonderful ways but refuses to do something that would be precious to us to keep us from becoming so heavenly minded that we\u2019re of no earthly good.  We don\u2019t know what Paul\u2019s thorn in the flesh is, but we can see it as he does: as part of God\u2019s working in a life for the good of one he dearly loves.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Sometimes the Lord does things for us because he loves us.  Sometimes the Lord doesn\u2019t do things for us because he loves us.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paul\u2019s thorn in the flesh 2Corinthians 12: The weaker I get the stronger I become.
