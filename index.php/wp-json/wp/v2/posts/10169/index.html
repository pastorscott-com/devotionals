Mysterious things happen. A mighty angel calls out and is answered by Seven Thunders. John dutifully starts to write it all down but is told, as the prophet Daniel was told centuries earlier, to seal up what he\u2019s just heard. To this day any effort to understand this scene is more a guess than anything else. Simply put, no one has a clue as to what\u2019s happening here. For an event in a book called \u201cRevelation\u201d it feels quite strange to have John commanded to silence. However, not knowing or understanding something leaves us in familiar territory. Frankly, what I do know of spiritual matters might fill a thimble. What I don\u2019t know would fill an ocean. That doesn\u2019t mean that I rejoice in my ignorance. I want to know all that\u2019s knowable and understand all that\u2019s understandable. This mysterious passage reminds me that not only am I not expected to fully understand everything that there are some things I\u2019m not allowed to understand even in part. In some cases, I explore the best I can, grasp as I\u2019m able and then move on, trusting God with all the mysteries that are beyond my grasp. In the specific case of this passage, I read it, scratch my head a bit, and move on; filing this mystery with a million others that I must leave in the capable hands of the Almighty.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We don\u2019t understand many of the things of God, but we can know him. That\u2019s enough.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A mystery within a mystery Revelation 10: Don\u2019t write a word.
