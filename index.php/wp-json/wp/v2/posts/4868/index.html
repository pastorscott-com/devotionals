Stop!<br \/>\n1 Chronicles 17: Nathan told David, \u201cWhatever is on your heart, go and do it; God is with you.\u201d<br \/>\nIt sounds so right.  David\u2019s throne is established and now the Ark resides in Jerusalem.  When David tells the man of God that he wants to build a Temple of worship Nathan never hesitates to place his stamp of approval on the project.  After all, David is God\u2019s man and who could ever deny God\u2019s man the privilege of building a great house of worship.  That night though, God speaks to Nathan.  The message is quite a positive one for David.  The Lord\u2019s pleased with David and the greatest leader in the history of the world will be one of his descendants.  But David isn\u2019t to build a Temple.  The prophet is a good man who returns to David the next day to relay this message from God.  The \u201cno Temple\u201d thing is brushed aside as David focuses in thanksgiving on the promises he\u2019s just received.  Still, I can\u2019t help but think about Nathan at this point.  When he tells David to go for it I think his heart\u2019s in the right place.  To him, this is a slam dunk that doesn\u2019t even require prayer.  He\u2019s probably the most surprised person in the world when he hears this word from the Lord.  Really, I don\u2019t think Nathan does anything wrong in this story.  His reaction to David\u2019s suggestion has the earmarks of a good man who delights in God being honored and served.  Still, his reaction to the message of the Lord is even better.  Think of it: he\u2019s already set sail on this Temple project.  In fact, he\u2019s granted permission in the Name of the Lord for it to proceed.  Then, with just one word from the Lord he pivots one hundred eighty degrees and goes straight to David with the correction.  This incident doesn\u2019t cause me to fear having opinions and reaching conclusions based on the facts as I know them.  It does, though, teach me not to hold too tightly to those conclusions.  Even as a dedicated Christian, I often reach the wrong conclusions.  Nathan\u2019s story is a good lesson in how I\u2019m to respond when I realize that has, once again, happened.<br \/>\nTake Away: For godly people to have godly opinions is a good thing, but even such people and such opinions are subject to God, himself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Go ahead&#8230;wait!
