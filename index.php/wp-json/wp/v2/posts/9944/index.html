In line after line he pronounces judgment on them.  They, who know more about the Laws of the Old Testament than anyone else, have strained all the grace and mercy out of it, leaving only a brittle, unyielding, damning crust.  They load people down with all that while stripping away the very essence of God.  Rather than pointing the way to a living relationship with a good, loving, and gracious God they point to rules and regulations and assured failure and doom.  To say it gently, Jesus thinks these rule-making, burden-loading, grace-denying individuals are bad people.  We Christians need to pay careful attention to this.  We understand that living in the Lord means that we abstain from some things and pursue others.  However, if that approach becomes the dominant one; if keeping all the rules becomes the definition of who we are in God; if we come to believe that \u201cknowing about\u201d God is our primary calling, then we\u2019ve taken a dangerous step toward the religion of the Pharisees.  In contrast to that brittle religion our Lord pictures God\u2019s desire for people as being like that of the mother hen who extends her embrace to her chicks.  If we lose sight of that and make the \u201chard side\u201d the main element of our relationship with the Lord we have more in common with the Pharisees than we might want to think.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christianity is more about love and grace and mercy than it is about knowing all the right things and keeping a list of rules.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Letting the Pharisees have it Matthew 23: They talk a good line, but they don\u2019t live it.
