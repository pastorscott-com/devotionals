His years in power are marked by spiritual and national failure and he leads his people into idol worship and detestable practices. Darkness descends as God withdraws his blessings on Judah. Neighboring Damascus betrays Ahaz and grinds Judah into the ground, humiliating it by taking treasures from the Temple. Ahaz, who\u2019s turned his back on Jehovah God, stupidly concludes that the gods of Damascus are preferable to the idols he\u2019s been worshipping. He copies their idols and brings worship of them to Jerusalem. What\u2019s wrong with this guy? He dumps the Lord God and then wonders why he and his nation are no longer blessed. Then, to add insult to injury, rather than return to the God of his father, he decides to try out the gods of Damascus. This guy is begging for judgment and he gets it. The old wisdom is that the first thing to do when one finds himself in a hole is to stop digging. Ahaz doesn\u2019t get it, so when he finds himself in trouble for rejecting God instead of stopping and reconsidering his course of action he doubles down on it making matters doubly worse. The thing is that this is exactly what I see people do today. They ignore God and go their own direction. Then, when things don\u2019t work out instead of repenting and returning to God, they double down and move even farther away from the Lord than they are already. There are a lot of young adults who were raised in the church and know better who keep adding one bad decision on top of another. Sad to say in them Ahaz has lots of company.<br \/>\nTake Away: Adding one minus to other minuses will never get us a \u201cplus\u201d result.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Doubling down on a losing hand 2 Chronicles 28: If I worship the gods who helped Damascus, those gods just might help me too.
