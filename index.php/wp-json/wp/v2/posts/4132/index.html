He urges them to relocate to Egypt where he can take care of them. As he sends them back to Canaan he adds, \u201cTake it easy and try to get along.\u201d Isn\u2019t that an odd statement? They\u2019re returning home with lots of good news. Joseph is alive, he\u2019s a powerful man, and he\u2019s going to take care of them all. It\u2019s been over 20 years since he spent time with them, but he\u2019s experienced firsthand the results of the rivalry among them. With that in mind he cautions them against disagreements in their number. Centuries later, Paul says something similar to the Christians at Rome: \u201cIf it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone\u201d (Ro 12:18). Apparently even people with good news and better things to do sometimes fail to get along. Joseph wants his brothers to keep the big picture in mind. Paul wants the same thing for the church. Once in a while, maybe all God\u2019s people need to be reminded to take it easy and to try to get along.<br \/>\nTake away: Getting along sometimes takes real effort on our part, but it\u2019s a worthy goal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can\u2019t we all just get along?
