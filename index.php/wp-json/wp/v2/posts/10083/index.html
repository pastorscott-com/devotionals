Paul writes with apostolic authority to the church there.  He lays it on the line, telling them that he\u2019s soon to make his third trip their city and that he\u2019s already warned them that if habitual sinners don\u2019t clean up their act that in the name of Jesus he\u2019ll clean up the church there.  He tells those who\u2019ve been demanding proof that he speaks for the Lord that, unless things improve, they\u2019ll get more proof than they want.  This is pretty strong stuff and it\u2019s not just a bluff.  Some years earlier, for instance, on the island of Paphos a sorcerer named Elymas opposed Paul\u2019s preaching of the gospel.  The Apostle turned to him, and without laying a hand on him struck him blind.  When Paul tells those who oppose his gospel at Corinth that if they don\u2019t straighten up they\u2019ll get plenty of reason to believe he speaks with the authority of the Lord he\u2019s not just making a lot of noise.  However, that isn\u2019t how Paul wants it to be.  His job is to bring people to the Lord so he can make them complete, not to strike people blind or worse.  Paul\u2019s approach here reminds me that spiritual things are serious and need to be handled carefully.  It\u2019s dangerous to be flip and irreverent.  It may seem that people get away with stuff like that, but Paul warns them (and us) that it\u2019s possible to go too far for too long and that to do so has real consequences.  At the same time I\u2019m reminded that that\u2019s not what Christian leadership is all about.  Paul has shown a great deal of patience in this situation.  He\u2019s prayed and pleaded and appealed to them as a father dealing with loved children.  He\u2019d much rather help broken people find restoration in Christ and, in fact, the only reason he warns them as he does in this case is that his mission of reconciliation is being threatened by some insiders who oppose this ministry.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Be carefully reverent about the things of God.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not a warm and fuzzy conclusion 2Corinthians 13: I want to get on with it, and not have to spend time on reprimands.
