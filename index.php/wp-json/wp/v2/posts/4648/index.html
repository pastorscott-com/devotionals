Some come to help and offer to join him; others come to cheer his seeming defeat. Shimei can be included in the second group. He\u2019s somehow related to Saul and this is his chance to let David know just how he feels about him. In his eyes, David stole the throne from Saul and is at fault for his death. It\u2019s probably a bigger deal that. Had Saul&#8217;s family retained the throne Shimei would have some prime position in government. Whatever the reason, he comes to taunt David and his companions as they leave Jerusalem. One of David&#8217;s men offers to go up and lop off Shimei&#8217;s head but David forbids it. This guy is really nothing, just hot air and noise. After all, his own son is out to kill him! The fact that one of his enemies cheers that almost makes sense. Wouldn\u2019t it would be nice if no one ever &#8220;kicked up dirt&#8221; in our lives and if everyone treated us with gentleness and respect. But that isn&#8217;t going to happen. Like David, we have to decide that not everyone\u2019s going to like us and some people are going to be happy when things aren&#8217;t going our way. We can&#8217;t run around beheading all those who are pleased that we&#8217;re having problems. Instead, we\u2019d better focus on being a people of God, doing his will and remaining victorious through the trial and leave such small potatoes matters alone.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t worry too much about people who oppose you \u2013 just focus on that which really matters, leaving their opposition in the hands of God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever had anyone kick up dirt in your life? 2 Samuel 16: Shimei followed along on the edge of the hill alongside, cursing, throwing stones down on them, and kicking up dirt.
