Two of these churches are in trouble. The third is doing quite well. One of the two that is failing on the surface looks quite healthy. It\u2019s a church that\u2019s operating an aggressive program with lots of meetings and activities \u2013 a full calendar. The other church that\u2019s failing believes in moderation. They feel they\u2019re successful and have earned a respite. Sorry to say, that attitude has caused them to take a bit of a break from God too. The result is a stern warning from Jesus. The third church, though, has been through some tough times. Many have fallen away leaving a small, but dedicated group that&#8217;s been tested in painful ways. Through it all they kept the Word of the Lord with \u201cpassionate patience.\u201d In other words, their love for the Lord has done nothing but increase even as they\u2019ve patiently worked through some of the hardest days of their lives. The Lord&#8217;s pleased with them and promises to open doors for them and to vindicate them and to keep them safe. As I read about these three churches my takeaway today isn\u2019t that it\u2019s a bad thing for a church to have an aggressive program or for church and people to take a breather once in a while. I don\u2019t come away thinking that to be small and poor is to be more spiritual. Frankly, I\u2019ve been around a few groups that were small and poor and proud of it. What does come to mind is that there are challenges to be found in just about every situation. A busy, successful church needs to be careful not to mistake what it does for Jesus for a vital, living relationship with him. A church that has had some success needs to be careful to keep its priorities straight. To personalize this farther, I need to remember that it\u2019s the same for individuals. The satisfied, fulfilled Christian life isn\u2019t defined by past success or current business for the Lord. It\u2019s all about living in a daily, connected relationship with him.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: My spiritual life isn\u2019t defined by what I\u2019ve done or am doing for the Lord. Rather, it\u2019s all about my living in a current, abiding relationship with him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not one size fits all Revelation 3: The people I love, I call to account \u2013 prod and correct and guide so that they\u2019ll live at their best.
