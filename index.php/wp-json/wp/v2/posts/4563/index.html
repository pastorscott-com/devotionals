We\u2019re told that his family calls David the &#8220;runt&#8221; and that Saul is a head and shoulders taller than the average man. When word comes to Saul that he has a volunteer to fight nine-foot-tall Goliath he&#8217;s pleased, but when he sees David, well, let&#8217;s just say David is a surprise to him. Saul rejects David as too young and inexperienced but David immediately states his credentials. Apparently, shepherding isn&#8217;t all about sitting around watching sheep and playing the harp. David has some war stories of his own, stories that include hand-to-hand (or better hand-to-claw or hand-to-teeth) combat with some pretty impressive adversaries. He didn&#8217;t just run the wild animals off. Rather, he grabbed them by the throat, wrung their necks, and killed them! Have you grabbed a bear by the neck lately? It\u2019s my understanding that this isn\u2019t considered a wise thing to do! Seriously, David knows that his ability to kill a lion or bear with his own hands is an extraordinary thing. In other words, he knows that he would be a dead man had it not been for God&#8217;s help, enabling him to be a lion killer even as Samson had done generations earlier. It\u2019s because of these victories that David&#8217;s ready to take on the big guy here. It\u2019s when I\u2019ve gone through smaller battles (although I am not sure how &#8220;small&#8221; fighting lions should be considered) and won by God&#8217;s help that I can take on giant issues with confidence. The same God who brought me though the smaller fights of life is well able to deliver me when I\u2019m in the fight of my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: As I remember the Lord\u2019s help in the past I face future challenges with greater confidence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wrestling with bears 1 Samuel 17: God, who delivered me from the teeth of the lion and the claws of the bear, will deliver me from this Philistine.
