For now, the seeds of the coming division are seen in arguing about who is most loyal to David. Shortly, Sheba of the tribe of Benjamin will try to divide Israel from Judah, but David&#8217;s forces will put down his rebellion. For now, we focus on the response of the men of Judah to the complaint that they&#8217;re being overly possessive of King David. Their answer is simple enough: &#8220;he\u2019s related to us.&#8221; They feel a special connection to David and real pride in his leadership. Because of that, they want to stick as close to him as possible. As Christians, we feel that way about our King. We\u2019ve been adopted into his family. He\u2019s our Master and Savior, but he\u2019s also our Brother. We want to stay as close to him as possible.
