The pagan king orders the three Hebrew men to worship his statue; it&#8217;s either worship or die in the furnace.  Their response is one for the ages: &#8220;The God we serve can rescue us from your roaring furnace&#8230;but even if he doesn&#8217;t&#8230;we still wouldn&#8217;t serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up.&#8221;  Now, that&#8217;s trusting faith!  I&#8217;ve never been where they are and I hope I never am.  However, if such a day comes I pray that I&#8217;ll have the same backbone they did.  At a much less intense level, I&#8217;m taken by their &#8220;even if he doesn&#8217;t&#8221; statement.  They knew what God &#8220;could&#8221; do but they weren&#8217;t sure of what he &#8220;would&#8221; do.  If they&#8217;re given a choice, they&#8217;ll vote for divine rescue, but, obviously they aren&#8217;t the ones choosing.  If they have to, they&#8217;ll go with option two: obedience even to death.  I, too, believe the Lord knows how to rescue his people.  However, there are times when it seems God has something bigger going on and my predicament isn\u2019t at the core of what&#8217;s happening.  At times like that the Lord trusts me to trust him.  So, &#8220;even if he doesn&#8217;t&#8221; do what I want, I declare my allegiance to him and then hold fast to it.<br \/>\nTake Away: The great test of faith isn\u2019t believing for a miracle.  Rather, it\u2019s believing when the miracle never comes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God trusting us to trust him Daniel 3: The God we serve can rescue us&#8230;but even if he doesn&#8217;t&#8230;.
