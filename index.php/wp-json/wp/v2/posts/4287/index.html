The dedication of the Tent of Meeting lasts twelve days with each day having its own pageantry and symbolism.  Each of the family tree groups gets a day of its own and as the days progress each family is connected to this sacred place. The offerings have been made and now Moses, instead of going up on the mountain to meet with God, enters the Most Holy Place in the new Worship Center to complete its dedication.  In an awesome moment, there above the Covenant Chest and between the golden angels God\u2019s Voice is heard.  Wow!  No longer will it take a trip up Mount Sinai for a meeting with the Lord.  Instead, he comes to them, dwelling right there at the heart of their camp.  It\u2019s impressive to remember that this wasn\u2019t Moses\u2019 idea.  The building and furnishing of the Tabernacle was initiated by the Lord, himself.  The Israelites don\u2019t have to figure out some way to get God\u2019s attention.  In fact, from the very beginning of their story it\u2019s the Lord who has reached out to them, initiating a relationship with them.  So it is to this day.  It isn\u2019t that I figure out just what I have to do to get God to respond to me.  Instead, from the start, he reaches out to me, inviting me to be his very own.  When I hear and respond I find that the Almighty is more than willing to allow me to connect my life to his.<br \/>\nTake Away: God has always been a communicating God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now that I have your attention Numbers 7: When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with God, he heard the Voice [of God]\u2026He spoke with him.
