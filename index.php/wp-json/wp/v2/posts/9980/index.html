He gets along with prostitutes and tax collectors, the very ones they use in their sermons as the kind of people who should be avoided at all cost.  Jesus, though, welcomes them.  He doesn\u2019t tell them to go clean up their acts and then come back.  Rather, he welcomes them just as they are.  When the religious leaders complain about this, Jesus tells three \u201clost and found\u201d stories.  In each story that which is lost is of real value and in each there\u2019s great rejoicing when it\u2019s found.  The religious leaders might think of these folks of doubtful reputation as worthless fodder for the fires of hell.  Jesus, however, places great value on them and when one of them comes and listens and then chooses to be a friend of his he thinks a celebration is in order.  As I read these lost and found stories I fear I\u2019m less like Jesus and more like the religious leaders who are represented as the elder son in the final parable.  In our society a Christian can pretty much saturate his or her life with \u201cChristian stuff.\u201d  If I handle things right, I can avoid these people of \u201cdoubtful reputation\u201d and not have to deal with them at all.  If I do that, though, I have more in common with the religious leaders than I do with Jesus. <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Jesus loves lost people and so should I.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jesus likes people of doubtful reputation Luke 15: A lot of men and women of doubtful reputation were hanging around Jesus.
