Even as Jeremiah faithfully proclaimed God&#8217;s word of condemnation on the nation, his competition described coming divine rescue.  Jeremiah&#8217;s message called for a radical change of attitude and lifestyle.  Their message was that everything was going to be just fine, that they were children of Abraham, and therefore, God had to keep his promises to him no matter what they did.  Because of their success in convincing people of their mistaken theology, Jeremiah&#8217;s message was rejected and those who needed to repent never did so.  I&#8217;m not writing today to put down some radio or TV preacher.  To tell the truth I don&#8217;t listen to any of them enough to even know their core message.  I do believe this, though: we preachers have a responsibility before God to call sinners to repentance.  If all we do is share principles for a happy marriage, or tell parents how to raise well-adjusted kids, or outline how to get along with the boss we&#8217;re failing people.  I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s never a time and place for such sermons, but Jeremiah says the preachers of his day didn&#8217;t confront people with their sin and therefore, they never realized their need for repentance.  Does this translate over to today?<br \/>\nTake Away: We have a responsibility before God to call sinners to repentance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Preach responsibility Lamentations 2: They didn&#8217;t face you with your sin so that you could repent.
