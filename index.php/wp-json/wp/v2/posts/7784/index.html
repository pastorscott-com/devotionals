The people of their day ignored their message and faced the consequences.  Now, all that is in the distant past and the people God claimed as his own are back in their home country, reestablishing their lives there.  Zechariah has a new word from the Lord.  Well, the word is new, but the message is old.  The Lord still calls people to an obedient walk with himself.  He still invites those who will to live in his fellowship and to participate in his holiness.  The messengers might have changed, but the purpose of God remains.  It\u2019s humbling to realize that, as a pastor, I have a role in this process today.  I know that someday my voice will be silenced (hopefully, not for a few decades yet) and hope that when the kids (these days, that\u2019s anyone less than thirty) look back on my ministry that they&#8217;ll remember me as one who was faithful in proclaiming the timeless truths of God.<br \/>\nTake Away: As people look back on our lives let them remember us as those who were faithful to God\u2019s call on our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Legacy of faithfulness Zechariah 1: But the Message&#8230;isn\u2019t dead and buried.
