Even as Saul had pursued David, now David&#8217;s own son Absalom has an army and is pursuing him. Even as, years earlier, David refused to kill Saul, he now gives orders that Absalom is to be spared. However, anyone hearing that order might find it a bit confusing. It\u2019s David who\u2019s on the run with inferior forces under his command. Absalom has the upper hand here, leading an army that David, himself, assembled. David prepares his forces for the fight and announces that he will lead in battle. However, his men are having none of it. To the core they&#8217;re loyal to David. They\u2019ll fight for him and die for him. What an encouragement it must be to David to have such loyal friends! I don&#8217;t have anyone trying to take my life, but when life is unfair, when I&#8217;m mistreated, it makes a wonderful difference to have some key people who let me know that they value me and are willing to take some hits for me.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for good friends.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A friend in need is a friend indeed 2Samuel 18: You are worth ten thousand of us.
