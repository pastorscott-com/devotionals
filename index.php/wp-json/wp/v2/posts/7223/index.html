Nothing works for them. Their worship is skin-deep, their vision of God is lost to spiritual blindness, and their relationship with their Creator is upside down and wrong side out! The Lord, through Isaiah, has no compliments for them. However, the Lord does have words of hope. It will take some doing but God\u2019s going to make them into a holy people. He\u2019s going to have people who worship in holiness, who reverence him as the holy God of Israel. Getting there is going to cost them everything. They\u2019ll lose the land God gave them and, frankly, many in this generation will lose their lives. Out of the destruction, God will begin remaking them into a people worthy of his Name. Today, God\u2019s still in the business of creating holy people. The process is, in some ways, the same. He brings us to the place where we give up everything, dying out to self. Once all else is gone he fills us with himself. This sanctification process is often painful for us as we struggle with the Lord over ownership of our lives. When we do surrender to him, though, the result is holiness; God honoring, wonderfully satisfied lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord is still in the business of creating holy people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sanctification Isaiah 29: These children will honor me by living holy lives.
