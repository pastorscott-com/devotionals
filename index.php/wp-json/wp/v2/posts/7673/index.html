Some have declared the promise of Micah and then of the Gospel writer to be a sham.  And why not: we&#8217;re no closer to world peace than we were when Micah first said these words.  The thing is our world hasn\u2019t cooperated with this promise.  Micah describes this when he says, \u201cMeanwhile, all the other people live however they wish.\u201d  The solution offered in the Bible is a spiritual one.  As people and nations yield to the sovereignty of God, peace reigns.  As people and nations reject God peace becomes more and more distant.   God\u2019s answer is to march onto the world scene and reorder it all.  When that happens we\u2019ll see the equivalent of an \u201cOpen, Under New Management\u201d sign placed on the world, and peace will, at least, reign.<br \/>\nTake Away: We can\u2019t expect to receive the promises of the Lord while we, at the same time, refuse to cooperate with him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Open, Under New Management Micah 4: Nations will&#8230;quit learning how to kill one another.
