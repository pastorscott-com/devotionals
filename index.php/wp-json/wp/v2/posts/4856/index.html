He\u2019s been open and honest and faithful.  Still, King Saul knows that his throne is, in reality, David\u2019s.   He\u2019s done nothing but be loyal to Saul yet he finds himself named public enemy number one.  David withdraws simply to save his own life.  However, like a magnet, he begins drawing fellow outcasts.  Saul can\u2019t find David, but everyday people just show up and ask to join him.  Before long, he commands a force to be reckoned with and some of the great warriors of history are numbered among David\u2019s band.  How\u2019d this happen?  I think God\u2019s finger prints are all over this.  The Lord picked David and now the Almighty\u2019s building his team for the work to be done.  Many years later David\u2019s most famous descendant has surrounded himself with twelve good men.  Still, there\u2019s much to do.  A great harvest beckons, but more workers are needed.  Jesus tells his core group to pray that the Father will send more harvest workers.  In David\u2019s day people who probably weren\u2019t even sure how they found him just showed up to join his cause.  In the Gospels, Jesus puts out a call for harvest workers.  Maybe we church leaders should take note of what happens here.  If we\u2019re doing what God wants done, he\u2019ll supply the people to do it.  The Lord doesn\u2019t use up human resources so we can do what we want to do.  However, as we see in David\u2019s case, he has an abundant supply of people to help us do what he wants done.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we\u2019re faithful to the Lord he\u2019ll supply the resources necessary for us to do what he wants done.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Department of human resources 1 Chronicles 12: Hardly a day went by without men showing up to help \u2013 it wasn\u2019t long before his band seemed as large as God\u2019s own army!
