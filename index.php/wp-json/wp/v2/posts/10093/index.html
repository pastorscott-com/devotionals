He\u2019s given us everything we need, in fact, abundantly more than we need to live victorious Christian lives.  With this in mind we\u2019re to take it all and run with it.  There\u2019s no need for fits and starts, stumbling and struggling back to our feet.  Rather we\u2019re to confidently move forward on our spiritual journey.  Some folks don\u2019t get it.  Rather than moving forward they wander along, taking detours in which they\u2019re in real danger of totally losing their way.  So, how can I best get on and stay on track?  The Apostle frames it in terms of relationships.  He describes the victorious Christian life as one filled with \u201cacts of love\u201d and in which things that strain our connection to our brothers and sisters in Christ are quickly recognized and resolved.  After all, he reminds us, we\u2019re traveling this road together and we\u2019re connected in our mutual love for our Master, Jesus.  If I fail to love and allow little things to fester in my relationships with God\u2019s people, I become one of those half-hearted, distracted Christians who are in danger of wandering so far from the path that I become lost in the darkness.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We really do need each other.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A secret to the victorious Christian life Ephesians 4: I don\u2019t want anyone strolling off, down some path that leads to nowhere.
