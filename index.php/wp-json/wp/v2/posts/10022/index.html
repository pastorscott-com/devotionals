He murders one of them, James, brother of John.  Then he arrests Peter, intending to publicly execute him.  However, Herod has heard some of the stories of miracles and he well remembers how the body of Jesus somehow escaped the tomb so he assigns sixteen guards to the fisherman.  Two are actually chained to him.  Meanwhile, the Church prays like it\u2019s never prayed before.  God hears and sends an angel to rescue Peter from the jail and the clutches of wicked Herod.  Poor servant Rhonda gets the laugh line every time this story is told.  She gets so excited that their prayers are answered that she leaves Peter standing in the street.  I\u2019m sure she laughed about it herself in the years to come.  When God answers prayer like that, in such a surprising and timely way, even the most faith filled prayer warrior might get a bit confused.  I can just imagine years later as various people who were present at that prayer meeting gather with friends for prayer.  Someone brings a seeming impossible request, maybe with a bit of defeat already mixed in.  That\u2019s when one of those prayer warriors from this passage speaks up.  \u201cDon\u2019t count God out.  Why, I remember a time when Peter was being guarded by sixteen soldiers&#8230;.\u201d  Everyone already knows the story but no one wants it to stop.  Answered prayers feed faith.  We need to cherish some of the really good answers and draw strength from them.  In fact, we need to use them to encourage those who need a \u201cfaith-lift\u201d as they pray over some difficult situation.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Answered prayers feed faith.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes God answers right now!
