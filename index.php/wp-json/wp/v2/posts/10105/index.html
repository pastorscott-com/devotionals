At that time he was a rather beaten up apostle, having just gone through the Philippian jail experience we read about in Acts 16. Some of his enemies, in fact, followed him to Thessalonica as well, resulting in a riot. Still, many believed his message and, in spite of his obvious weaknesses, they became dear friends of Paul. This relationship, he tells them, is cherished and warms his heart even as he writes them this short letter. Looking back on those events, even though there was some pain and rejection in them, fills him with thanksgiving. He remembers how he gave them his heart and to this day he has no regrets about it whatsoever. There\u2019s something powerful about relationships like this. For one thing, they hold. Paul has moved on in his ministry but something of him has stayed with his dear friends in Thessalonica. Now, when they have questions about the Second Coming of Christ they turn to him for answers. When he hears from them, he experiences some old blessings made new. I don\u2019t think I should live in the past, dwelling on the \u201cgood old days.\u201d Still, there\u2019s a time for looking back and remembering people, events, friendships, and blessings from days gone by. I can\u2019t live in the past but it doesn\u2019t hurt to visit there once in a while.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Precious memories sweeten our lives today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking back and being blessed all over again 1Thessalonians 2: We wanted to give you our hearts.
