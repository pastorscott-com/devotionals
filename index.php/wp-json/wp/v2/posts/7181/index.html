No one wants to spend the rest of their days dealing with some painful situation.  However, I also know that just about everyone has their share of &#8220;hurt and grieving.&#8221;  In fact, some folks have more than their share of such things.  Some of the finest people I know carry a burden of broken health, broken dreams, and painful loss with them every day.  I\u2019ve noticed that, for some, those difficulties somehow deepen them.  They know how to enjoy life, but there\u2019s an attractive stability and perspective on life in them.  The writer of Ecclesiastes says that we\u2019re wise to invest something of ourselves in those challenging parts of life.  When I make an investment, I give something of value because I expect to get a return on my investment.  When I go through the darkness I tend to rush through it as quickly as possible.  This portion of Ecclesiastes reminds me that there\u2019s something for me even there if I\u2019ll trust the Lord enough to give myself to such difficulties.<br \/>\nTake Away: Obviously, no one wants to go through hard times, but even in such times the Lord can work in our lives, deepening us, making us more like his Son, Jesus.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investing in painful circumstances Ecclesiastes 7: Sages invest themselves in hurt and grieving.
