There\u2019s a big cloud that glows like fire at night.  All they have to do is follow it.  When it moves, they move.  When it stands still, they stand still.  That\u2019s the one that catches my attention: \u201cstand still.\u201d  I do a lot better job of moving.  After all, I\u2019m a valuable part of the Kingdom of God and I\u2019m sure the Lord needs for me to be in the game from start to finish.  Other players might get a break but no bench time for me! Well, seriously, I know there\u2019s always something else to be done.  I need to take note that even as the Lord leads the Israelites in this clear and unmistakable way that sometimes he leads them to stop.  For one thing that means taking time out.  God built a day off into the very fabric of Creation.  A minimum of one day out of seven is a day for the Pillar of Cloud in our lives to stand still.  Another thing that comes to mind is that I don\u2019t listen to God very well when I\u2019m on the move.  His Voice is precious, but it\u2019s often so quiet that I won\u2019t hear it at all unless I still my life and pay attention.  Every day needs to have times when the Pillar of Cloud stands still for a while and I focus my attention entirely on the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: Taking time out is not only a good thing to do, it\u2019s actually a requirement. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time Out Numbers 9: They camped at God\u2019s command and they marched at God\u2019s command.
