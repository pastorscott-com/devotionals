This allows the land to rebuild and continue to produce a good yield.  Then there\u2019s a once in a lifetime event called the Year of Jubilee that comes each fifty years.  Again, there\u2019s to be no dirt farming during that year but there\u2019s a lot more to it.  The Israelites will be given land by family.  That land is their inheritance for all time.  Because of that, they can\u2019t sell the land to another family.  Instead, they\u2019re to do a sort of lease agreement that can last no longer than the next Year of Jubilee.  In that year, all land reverts to the original families.  Still, there\u2019s more.  An Israelite can sell himself into slavery to another Israelite, but it really isn\u2019t slavery.  Instead, it\u2019s more like indentured servanthood.  The term can end at an agreed upon time, but in all cases, it must end on the Year of Jubilee.  When the value of the person\u2019s service is being calculated this must be taken into consideration.  From what I\u2019ve read the Israelites were unfaithful in observing Jubilee and it was only practiced, I think, once.  Still, there\u2019s a lot of wisdom in this approach.  It gives the land rest, protects against the wealthy buying up all the land (very important in an agricultural society), and guarantees human freedom even in a culture all too familiar with the concept of slavery.  The Year of Jubilee is an example of how the Lord gives rules intended, not to bind to unreasonable laws, but to protect the weak from unscrupulous people of means.  Of course, there are some neat spiritual parallels.  In Luke four Jesus proclaims his ministry to be \u201cthe year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\u201d  His ministry is a Jubilee sort of ministry in which things are made right and those held captive by sin are set free.  The Israelites may have never put the Jubilee concept into practice, but to our benefit Jesus the Messiah does just that.<br \/>\nTake Away: In Christ we are set free and things are made right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Year of Jubilee Leviticus 25: Sanctify the fiftieth year; make it a holy year.
