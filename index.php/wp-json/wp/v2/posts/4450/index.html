I want to try another time with the fleece.<br \/>\nHere we are reading about Gideon and his fleece of wool. Actually, Gideon asks for, and receives, three signs from God. First, the angel of the Lord causes a fire to miraculously appear and consume his offering. Second, his fleece of wool gets wet from the dew while everything else stays dry. Third, the situation is reversed and the fleece stays dry while everything else gets wet from the dew. This is interesting reading, but it isn&#8217;t a lesson in how we\u2019re supposed to deal with God. We\u2019re to be people of faith, trusting in the Lord and learning to hear his voice. We\u2019re not supposed to be sign-seekers and deal-makers. The star of this story isn\u2019t Gideon, a near heathen who keeps getting signs from God confirming what he\u2019s clearly already been told. The Star is God, who is patient even when Gideon keeps asking him to prove his own words. I\u2019m thankful for a patient God who puts up with my shallowness even as he works to produce in me a more mature relationship with himself. Generally speaking though, I need to just do whatever it is God has made clear to me without &#8220;putting out a fleece.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t press God\u2019s patience \u2013 just obey in the first place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Putting out a fleece Judges 6: Let me say one more thing.
