It feels as if it was just tossed in after the fact, maybe written while Luke was thinking of what to next tell us about the ministry of Jesus.  We\u2019ve just heard Jesus preach while sitting in Simon\u2019s boat and then watched as, under the command of Jesus, Simon and partners have caught a huge haul of fish.  Now Jesus is healing a man with leprosy and soon he\u2019ll be surrounded by people seeking healing and with Pharisees seeking arguments.  Right in the middle of all this action is this one liner about Jesus slipping away for prayer.  Obviously, this is more than random filler from Luke.  He wants me to connect the mighty acts of Jesus with his secret prayer life.  As he teaches and heals God\u2019s power flows out of him.  In his secret prayer life God\u2019s power is replenished in him.  This is no chance thought of Luke\u2019s.  Rather, he\u2019s providing me with insight into the power source of our Lord.  Another devotional thought here is that in spite of the fact that Jesus is a busy man he makes time for prayer.  When the last needy person has been satisfied and these new disciples find themselves and Jesus finally alone they expect to enjoy some quality time with their Lord, or at least some down time before it all starts again in the morning.  James and John look around and realize Jesus isn\u2019t there.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Jesus?\u201d they ask.  \u201cHe\u2019s down by the lake,\u201d Peter answers, adding, \u201cHe said something about needing some time alone.\u201d  This is to become a daily pattern that the disciples will come to expect.  If it\u2019s good for Jesus it\u2019s good for me too.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: There\u2019s always time, and the necessity, for prayer.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So where\u2019s Jesus now?
