In fact, he wants nothing to do with him.  His brief encounter with Jesus has been disturbing and dissatisfying.  He senses that this isn\u2019t just another internal squabble among the Jews.  Something more is going on here.  The accused man has self-confidence and something even more that Pilate can\u2019t quite put his finger on.  This business of his being \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d somehow resonates.  The Jews are using this to force his hand.  After all, no Roman governor wants it reported to Caesar that he tolerates locals claiming to be kings.  Finally he has Jesus brought to Gabbatha, and takes his place on the seat of judgment.  He wants to get this distasteful business over with and to get on with his morning\u2019s responsibilities.  Pilate sits on the judgment seat and Jesus stands before him.  He condemns Jesus to death.  It\u2019s the world turned upside down and it\u2019s a situation that will be rectified on Judgment Day.  On that day it will be King Jesus sitting on the judgment seat and it will be Pilate who will stand before him.  No doubt, his part in the injustice of this distant day will be very much in play at that time.  Of course, this scene doesn\u2019t only concern Pilate.  I too will have my turn at Gabbatha.  My only hope is to right now make the Judge also my Savior.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Now is the time to prepare for my Day of Judgment.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Gabbatha John 19: He sat down at the judgment seat.
