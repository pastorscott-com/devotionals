It isn&#8217;t war that\u2019s unique to human experience, its peace.  Human history, including that which is included in the Bible, is filled with war and every generation seems to take its turn at it.  Israel&#8217;s possession of the Promised Land started with a war and it&#8217;s still at war today.  Isaiah&#8217;s promise of peace sounds as fantastic today as it did then.  However, his promise isn&#8217;t that of a politician who sincerely promises a &#8220;war to end all wars&#8221; but all too soon sees an even more devastating conflict break out.  Isaiah&#8217;s promise isn\u2019t man-centered, but is, instead, God-centered.  The secret to peace on Earth isn\u2019t &#8220;one more war&#8221; or &#8220;bigger weapons&#8221; or even the leadership of some gifted peace-maker.  That&#8217;s because the real battle field isn\u2019t in the Middle East or any other geographical location.  Rather, it\u2019s the human heart.  James put it this way, &#8220;What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don\u2019t they come from your desires that battle within you?&#8221; (James 4:1).  Until the conflict of the human heart is resolved there isn&#8217;t a chance &#8220;in the world&#8221; of peace between nations.  Our hope then is Christ.  It\u2019s the peaceful rule of the Messiah that Isaiah looked to.  Today, I\u2019m reminded that the dominion of the one who &#8220;on earth brings peace to men&#8221; begins, not out on the battle field, but in my heart.<br \/>\nTake Away: The only hope of peace in the world is Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Peace Maker Isaiah 2: No more will nation fight nation; they won&#8217;t play war anymore.
