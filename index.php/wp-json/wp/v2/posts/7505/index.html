They think they&#8217;re like dinosaur bones some archeologist might dig up in the desert someday: interesting, but dry and lifeless.  The truth is that they&#8217;re right.  They&#8217;ve been written off because of their rejection of God.  To picture themselves as &#8220;dry bones&#8221; is not an overreaction.  Rather, it\u2019s a valid realization.  Their only hope is the only hope they&#8217;ve ever had: they must turn back to God.  In his vision Ezekiel is asked, &#8220;Can these bones live?&#8221;  His answer is right on: &#8220;Lord, you know.&#8221;  The restoration of Israel is up to the Lord.  They&#8217;re on the verge of being written off of the pages of history.  The only possibility of their not becoming dry fossils is to respond to the mercy of God and depend on him to breathe life back into them.  All of that is true of my life too.  It&#8217;s only when I accept two facts that I have hope.  Fact one: my sins have made me spiritually into a pile of dry bones.  Fact two: my only hope is in God&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness.  The only route out of this mess is for me to accept the title, &#8220;dry bones&#8221; and then listen to God&#8217;s message.  That alone can change my dry bones situation.<br \/>\nTake Away: Our only hope is in the mercy and forgiveness of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Them bones, them bones, them dry bones Ezekiel 37: Dry bones, listen to the message of God.
