Your people are my people, your God is my god.<br \/>\nA family of refugees moves into her neighborhood and over time she falls in love with and marries one of the sons. Her in-laws often surprise Ruth. Their ways are different than hers. Most unique is their religion. They have but one God and they tell many stories of his deliverance of their people and his love for them. Their laws are just and intended to protect the weak. Even as Ruth is becoming a part of this family, the family begins coming apart. First, her father-in-law dies. Then her brother-in-law passes away and soon after that her own husband dies. In time, her broken-hearted mother-in-law declares that she&#8217;s releasing the wives of her two deceased sons. The young women can marry again and start life anew. As for her, it&#8217;s time she returns home. How sad: she left her homeland with a husband and two fine sons. Now she&#8217;ll return alone. Ruth is having none of this. In Naomi she has not only a mother-in-law but also a friend. Beyond that, going back to her old life, now that she\u2019s had had a glimpse of something better, is unthinkable. So we come to her beautiful statement of commitment. She will cast her lot with Naomi. She will be her friend and she will make Naomi&#8217;s values and Naomi&#8217;s God her own. I wonder if my life, even in the face of heartache, has the potential to cause anyone to say, &#8220;I will serve and love the God you serve and love.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s something attractive about a God-centered life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Full commitment Ruth 1: Where you go, I go; and where you live, I&#8217;ll live.
