He\u2019s troubled that a holy God would use such unholy people as his workers in the world.  Having asked his questions of God, Habakkuk braces himself for God\u2019s answer.  The first thing he hears from God is that the Lord does, indeed, have an answer for him.  The second message he receives is that sometimes God\u2019s answers appear to be slow in coming but they\u2019re worth waiting for, and when they do come, it&#8217;s plain that God not only answered well, but the answer came at just the right time.  This passage is a wonderful blessing to all who have dealt with hard things in their lives; who have asked God for help in understanding them but haven\u2019t yet received an answer.  At such times God\u2019s word to Habakkuk is also his word to us: \u201cwait.\u201d  I\u2019m not a big fan of waiting but in this passage I\u2019m reminded that God hasn\u2019t forgotten me and he isn\u2019t ignoring me.  At just the right time \u2013 in God\u2019s time \u2013 the answer will come.  When it does, it will have been well worth the wait.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes the Lord\u2019s answers appear to be slow in coming but they\u2019re worth waiting for.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Waiting for God\u2019s response Habakkuk 2: If it seems slow in coming wait&#8230;it will come right on time.
