King Hezekiah sends representatives to God\u2019s man, Isaiah, to seek a response from the Lord. God doesn\u2019t let Hezekiah down. The Lord has heard the threats and the blasphemy and is going to personally deal with the situation. Not long after that, Sennacherib is called away to deal with a crisis elsewhere in his kingdom. However, before he leaves he sends a letter to Hezekiah, promising that he\u2019ll be back to finish the destruction of Jerusalem just as he promised. Upon receiving that letter Hezekiah takes it to the Temple. There, in the presence of God he opens that scroll and spreads it out before the Lord. He prays, reminding himself and God of the promise the Lord made to take care of Sennacherib and to protect his people. I love what Hezekiah does with that letter. He knows that the Lord has promised to deliver him but that letter and the threat it contains is real. Rather than letting it consume him with fear he takes it to the Lord. This is a lesson I need to learn. What difference might it make if I take that lab report from the doctor that\u2019s causing me concern and lay it out before the Lord when I pray? Or maybe a good course of action is to write out the situation from work that\u2019s worrying me and then lay it out before the Lord? I\u2019m not saying that this is some magical formula for getting the Lord to do what I want him to do. However, I do think that it might serve as a practical reminder to me that God does know about these difficult situations and that he has promised to walk with me through even in them.<br \/>\nTake Away: In the words of the old hymn: \u201cOh, what peace we often forfeit, oh, what needless pain we bear, all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2007 &#8211; Blanchard Caverns, Arkansas Taking it to the Lord Isaiah 37: Then he went into the sanctuary of God and spread the letter out before God.
