He rescues the one he loves and puts him back on his feet, giving him victory. From that experience, David says he\u2019s learned some things about God. The Lord sticks by people who stick by him. When I turn to him, I find he\u2019s already turned to me. And, even when I know I\u2019m unworthy, I\u2019m surprised by his wonderful love for me.
