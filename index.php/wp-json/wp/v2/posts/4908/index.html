The result is that he loses half his Kingdom. From now on we\u2019ll have twin kingdoms: Israel and Judah. Right off Israel enthrones an evil man who shuts down the worship of Jehovah God. However, not everyone in Israel is on his side and several relocate to Judah, not because they like Rehoboam all that much but because they want to worship the Lord. One group, in particular, is mentioned. Traditionally the Levites have served God, first in the Tabernacle and then at the Temple. Now, the Levites living in the new nation of Israel have a decision to make. Will they abandon their calling or will they abandon their property? Many, we\u2019re told, decide for God. They leave home that they can be true to their calling and serve God in Jerusalem. I\u2019m impressed by their decision as I\u2019m impressed by stories of people who leave home to live in some distant place in response to the call of missions. The most many of us can say about following the Lord is that we\u2019ve been inconvenienced at times. Here\u2019s a group of people who abandoned everything to be faithful to God\u2019s call on their lives. People who make that kind of decision are worthy of our admiration. The Lord\u2019s impressed by it too. As Jesus says in Luke 18, \u201cNo one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.\u201d<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for people who are willing to live out their faith even in the face of real personal sacrifice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leaving everything to follow 2 Chronicles 11: The Levites left their pastures and properties and moved to Judah and Jerusalem.
