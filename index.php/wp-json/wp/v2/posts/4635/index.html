We don&#8217;t know much about Nathan, but he carries on in the spirit of his predecessor, Samuel. In Nathan we see the same boldness we saw in Samuel when he stood up to Saul. A few pages back, when David wants to build a Temple, its Nathan who first agrees but then returns with the disappointing news that God doesn&#8217;t want David to build a Temple. Now, when David has fallen in sin, it\u2019s Nathan who takes his life in his hands and confronts the king with what he\u2019s done. The prophet is pretty smart in his approach. He comes to David with a made-up scenario about a farmer and a lamb. When David reacts with righteous indignation over what he thinks has happened Nathan responds with the famous words, &#8220;You&#8217;re the man!&#8221; David, who could have any available woman in Israel (it\u2019s acceptable in this society for him to have multiple wives), instead wanted another man&#8217;s wife. David, who\u2019s bravely fought God&#8217;s enemies all his life, has used God&#8217;s enemies to do his dirty work for him. It\u2019s Nathan who stands up to David. It&#8217;s nice to be God&#8217;s spokesman and tell people about the story of God&#8217;s love for us, preaching sermons from John 3:16. However, there\u2019s a place for confrontation too. We\u2019d just better be sure it\u2019s God who\u2019s sending us with that strong message.<br \/>\nTake Away: No one is big enough, so valuable to God\u2019s Kingdom, that they can get away with sin.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wonder if Nathan checked his life insurance policy first 2 Samuel 12: You&#8217;re the man!
