It\u2019s then that he begins to sink.  Hundreds of years before that, the sons of Korah write this Psalm dealing with the same issue.  As is abundantly clear with the drowning Peter, they don&#8217;t suggest that God\u2019s people go about pretending all is well.  We\u2019re to admit that we\u2019re down in the dumps and maybe even feeling neglected by God, about to be crushed.  The solution they give us is the very same thing we learn from Peter&#8217;s unforgettable experience on and then in the water: we\u2019re to fix our eyes on the One who loves us and promises to be with us.  Toward the back of our Bibles we find the writer of Hebrews telling us, again, to &#8220;fix our eyes on Jesus.&#8221;  Since we find this truth here in the Psalms, and then see it powerfully illustrated by Peter in the gospels, and then are taught the same truth again in the book of Hebrews you\u2019d think that we\u2019d have such a firm grasp on it that it would be part of our spiritual DNA.  However, this lesson has to not only be learned, but then relearned; again and again.  I think I forget it because I tend to attempt to be self-sufficient.  I want the Lord to be impressed with me, so I try to handle it myself.  Or, the problem is that I\u2019m so &#8220;now oriented&#8221; that I can&#8217;t see the bigger picture of God&#8217;s faithful provision for me even in the storms of life.  Either way, the answer is given here.  When I look to the Lord, even in the harshness of life, in the words of Korah&#8217;s sons, &#8220;soon I&#8217;ll be praising again.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: If we \u201cfix our eyes\u201d on anyone or anything aside from the Lord we\u2019ll end up being let down and disappointed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking to the Lord in the midst of the storm Psalm 42: Fix my eyes on God &#8211; soon I&#8217;ll be praising again.
