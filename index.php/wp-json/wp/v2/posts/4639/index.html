This story about his daughter Tamar and sons Ammon and Absalom illustrates the truth of this statement by Nathan. It&#8217;s pretty ugly stuff. Ammon is in love with his half-sister Tamar. His first cousin Jonadab tells him to get her alone and force himself on her. Ammon takes Jonadab&#8217;s advice and ends up raping Tamar. When David hears what\u2019s happened, he\u2019s outraged, but does nothing about it. Could it be that his memory of his own relationship with Bathsheba stops him from acting? Technically, he didn&#8217;t rape Bathsheba, but when he sent for her on that terrible day, he did so with all the authority of the throne. She really couldn&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221; to the king. Beyond that, what David did went public. His family, including Ammon, knew all about it. Surely, knowing that his father took another man&#8217;s wife when he wanted her influenced his thinking in this. So Ammon rapes Tamar. When David fails to act, her full brother, Absalom decides to take matters into his own hands. He murders Ammon. Clearly, this isn\u2019t a pretty story. No one in this incident except the victim is portrayed in a positive manner. David has repented of his sin and been forgiven by the Lord, but there are still consequences to his failure. This isn&#8217;t God punishing David by encouraging rape and murder in his family. Instead, it\u2019s the outflow of David&#8217;s willful actions. Our actions have consequences, some reaching farther and into places we\u2019d never imagine.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t underestimate your influence \u2013 for good or for bad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The reach of sin 2 Samuel 13: Kill him&#8230;and don&#8217;t be afraid.
