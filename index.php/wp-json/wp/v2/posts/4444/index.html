I guess it could be argued that Moses&#8217; sister Miriam qualifies, and maybe she does, but Deborah really shines here.  Sisera is the commander of an occupying army that&#8217;s dominating the Israelites and Deborah is their recognized leader.  She calls for Barak, another well-known Israelite, and tells him that it has become clear to her that God\u2019s going to deliver them from Sisera and his army.  Barak, though, is afraid to proceed without Deborah at his side.  Deborah replies that because of his fear, God will use a woman&#8217;s hand to take care of Sisera, and she, not him, will get the credit.  It all plays out as she said and, not only does Deborah go down in history as the one who leads the way to freedom a woman named Jael finishes Sisera off.  Long before the promise of &#8220;daughters prophesying&#8221; is fulfilled in Acts 2, we find God using women as leaders in his work.  Thank God for women who are willing to be used of God to accomplish his purposes.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord uses willing people, and there\u2019s to gender qualification in it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Woman power Judges 4: God will use a woman&#8217;s hand to take care of Sisera.
