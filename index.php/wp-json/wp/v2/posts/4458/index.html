A lot of the bleakness comes from within. Gideon apparently makes himself into a sheik and fathers lots of children. When he dies there\u2019s a power struggle that\u2019s won by Abimelech, the son of Gideon and one of his maidservants. Abimelech seals the deal by murdering his seventy brothers. However, he\u2019s better at murder than he is at leading and within three years there\u2019s mounting opposition to his rule. Abimelech acts to quash the rebellion and arrives at Thebez, a town known for its fortified tower. As this wicked leader prepares burn alive those who have taken refuge there a woman drops part of a millstone on his head, thus bringing an end to the short and evil leadership of Abimelech. This is an ugly, if somewhat interesting story of a bad man who does bad things and then dies in a violent, unexpected way. No doubt, the detail of his inglorious death is told to us that we might see the judgment of God on Abimelech. In the larger view, I\u2019m reminded that when God is removed from their lives just how much these descendants of Abraham look like the other heathen of that land. When I look around my community and see people doing stupid, self-destructive things to themselves and one another; when I see them blindly pursuing worthless things; and when I see them stubbornly traveling down the wrong road I\u2019m wise to remember that without the Lord in my life that could easily be me. One response then, is to be thankful for what the Lord&#8217;s doing in my life. It\u2019s not about me \u2013 it\u2019s all about him. Another response is that, rather than feeling superior, I\u2019m to be compassionate to them. These are people who are like me.
