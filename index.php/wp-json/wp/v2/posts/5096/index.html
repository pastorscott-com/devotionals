However, he says, their good times are always short-lived and then everything falls apart for them.  Job is having none of it.  He replies that he\u2019s watched things too, and it isn&#8217;t very often that such people get their just deserts.  In fact, he&#8217;s attended their funerals and heard the lies said about them even as their bodies were lowered into the ground.  The big theme of Job&#8217;s story is &#8220;will a man serve God for nothing.&#8221;  Then, as things play out, we\u2019re confronted with the issue of human suffering.  Is it possible that people suffer and it isn&#8217;t because God is angry with them?  Now, we meet yet another theme.  It\u2019s the reverse concern.  If it\u2019s true, as Job contends, that sometimes people suffer through no fault of their own, is it also true that sometimes evil people get away with it?  Is it possible that some enjoy all the pleasures of sin all the way to old age and never hit the brick wall of God&#8217;s judgment?  I think that before this ordeal Job was fairly comfortable with Zophar&#8217;s philosophy.  At least he hadn\u2019t given it much thought.  Now, he finds himself dealing with the issue of how unjust life can be.  All the time God remains silent, allowing Job and his friends to grapple with it all.  For most of us, reading through these discussions is more philosophical than anything else.  Once in a while though, these issues become quite serious and they did for Job so long ago.<br \/>\nTake Away: Some people live their entire lives believing things to be true that aren\u2019t.  Once in a while though, we\u2019re given the opportunity (or maybe \u201cforced\u201d is a better word) to get a fresh grip on \u201ctruth.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Getting away with it Job 21: They&#8217;re given fancy funerals with all the trimmings.
