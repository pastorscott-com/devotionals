I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to see, but I&#8217;m wrong.  Instead, I see a picture of God&#8217;s love for the sinner; a love so powerful that even when Israel appears to have sinned away the day of grace that God can&#8217;t give up on them.  The Lord&#8217;s in anguish over their rejection and says, &#8220;How can I give up on you?  How can I turn you loose?&#8221;   It\u2019s a dramatic vision of God&#8217;s love.  In fact, it&#8217;s here I find myself face-to-face with love beyond human capacity.  Even as I read these words of love and mercy I find myself wondering how God can go so far in his forgiveness and how he can love in such an overwhelming way.  It&#8217;s then that I find the answer.  God loves with intensity beyond what I can comprehend because of who he is.  He&#8217;s God and not man.  Here&#8217;s love in the superlative; super-human love.  I thank God that today I am a recipient of that love.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is love.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Superhuman love Hosea 11: I am God and not a human&#8230;I&#8217;m here &#8212; in your very midst.
