David then gave the last years of his life preparing for this great construction project. Now, it\u2019s finished and it\u2019s not only a beautiful house of worship but is a monument to the trustworthiness of God who always keeps his promises. As I read and write devotionally from the Bible this theme comes up quite often and it\u2019s no big surprise that it does. In the opening pages of the Bible, right after that Fall God begins making promises. Following the Flood there\u2019s another big promise that the Lord will never again send a flood to wipe humanity off the face of the earth. Then, we come to a major promise as the Lord speaks to Abram. We find instances of God making and then keeping promises throughout the Scriptures. Here, as Solomon is about to pray his memorable prayer of dedication, he prefaces it by reminding us that God is the original Promise Maker and Promise Keeper. So, as we\u2019re about to bow our heads and listen to the prayer of the wise King, let\u2019s take one more look at the gleaming white Temple and remember that God is always faithful.<br \/>\nTake Away: Heaven and earth may pass away but his word will never pass away.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The unfailing faithfulness of God 2 Chronicles 6: And now you see the promise completed.
