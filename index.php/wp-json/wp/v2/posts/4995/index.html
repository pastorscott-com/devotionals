His enemies have tried intimidation but Nehemiah refuses to be intimidated. Now they resort to the ploy of trying to lure him away from Jerusalem where they can do him harm. They suggest a meeting of the minds, a &#8220;friendly&#8221; get together where they can discuss their differences. Nehemiah sees it all for what it is: an attempt to stop him from doing what God called him to do. Four times they invite him to cease the work and come to their meeting and each time he sends word back, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing a great work; I can&#8217;t come down.&#8221; Not everything I do is a &#8220;great work.&#8221; Sometimes I\u2019d be better off to put my agenda on hold and go to a meeting instead. However, if I\u2019m sure it\u2019s God&#8217;s work that I\u2019m doing I too can respond in Nehemiah&#8217;s words. In fact, I ought to. This principle applies to pastors who are being used of God right where they are when the opportunity is offered to move to a more prestigious pulpit. It&#8217;s true of denominational leaders who ought to sometimes say, &#8220;Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I\u2019m where God wants me to be right now.&#8221; It&#8217;s true of church people who, instead of saying, &#8220;That church down the road has a better music (children&#8217;s, teen&#8217;s, senor adult&#8217;s, etc.) program so we\u2019re going to go there.&#8221; If you\u2019re where God wants you to be there\u2019s no better program or position or pulpit. Just tell &#8217;em that you are &#8220;doing a great work and can&#8217;t come down.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The greatest place to be is right in the center of the will of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Doing a great work Nehemiah 6: I&#8217;m doing a great work; I can&#8217;t come down.
