Jacob hangs around the house, preferring the comforts of home to the adventures of the outdoors. Esau lives for the hunt and might be called a \u201cman\u2019s man.\u201d On this occasion Esau\u2019s hunting expedition has been unfruitful and he returns home empty handed and with an empty stomach. Meanwhile, Jacob has cooked some red stew which happens to be Esau\u2019s favorite. When his brother demands a meal, Jacob plays \u201clet\u2019s make a deal\u201d with him. Esau can have his stew if he\u2019ll give his birthright to him. This is a big deal. Their father is wealthy and being the first born gives Esau the rights to the vast majority of that wealth. Esau, though, is interested in one thing: his empty stomach. Without hesitation he makes what is a very good deal for Jacob and a very bad deal for himself. I think we\u2019re living in the age of Esau. Our entire society is focused on living for today. People trade away their sexual purity for a passing feel-good fling. Government spends money it doesn\u2019t have, strapping our descendants with huge debt, to avoid a downturn in the economy and some disgruntled voters. Comfort and pleasure rule the day and like Esau we trade our birthright for a bowl of soup. Anytime I fail to recognize the larger values of life and focus on my current wants I\u2019m in danger of joining Esau in his folly.<br \/>\nTake away: A life without proper priorities is bound to be a wasted life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The high price of stew these days Genesis 25: My stew for your rights as the firstborn.
