Simply put, they feel right at home with these heathen.  In his anger, God turns his back on them and soon everything falls apart.  How at home am I in my society?  Jesus loved sinners.  He ate with them and genuinely liked them.  But he never became one of them. On one hand there\u2019s the example of the Israelites who feel so at home with the Canaanites that they adopt their ways.  On the other hand we have Jesus who loves people and fellowships with them, but in doing so, invites them to be the ones who are changed.
