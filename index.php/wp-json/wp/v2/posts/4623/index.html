His long struggle with Saul has come to an end. The promise made to him when he was a mere shepherd has come to pass and he sits securely on the throne of Israel. Even the Ark of the Covenant is now at rest in the city called the &#8220;City of David.&#8221; David&#8217;s comfortable and settled and he wants the same for the precious Chest of God, so he proposes the first ever permanent worship structure, a Temple, for Israel. To his surprise God says &#8220;no.&#8221; It isn&#8217;t that the Lord&#8217;s against the building of such a place but this is not the time. Still, God&#8217;s pleased with David and he tells him so. David will become one of the most famous people in the world. He\u2019ll reign in peace and when his days on earth are over it will be one of his own offspring who will rule Israel. Even as the Lord fully rejected Saul he now fully accepts David. His family will rule Israel forever. David doesn&#8217;t know it, but he\u2019s just heard the promise of the Messiah. One of his descendants will be King of kings and Lord of lords. He\u2019ll rule, not only Israel, but all of Creation &#8212; forever! I\u2019m not a part of the people of Israel but, today, I\u2019m a beneficiary of the promise God makes to David. That ultimate Ruler only hinted at in this passage is the Ruler of my life. How wonderful to read about an event that happened thousands of years ago and to suddenly find myself a part of the story!<br \/>\nTake Away: All those who live by faith have a place in the story of the people of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m part of this story 2 Samuel 7: God himself will build you a house!
