Somehow, in ways beyond my comprehension, God desires a relationship with me. God, you see, is all about relationships. In the Creation he seeks relationships so much that he creates beings with free will. Only such creatures can genuinely connect with him. In the Garden Adam and Eve enjoy the fellowship with God, functioning as they&#8217;re created to function. When they sin, they break that fellowship and distance themselves from God. What will he do? Will he press the \u201creset\u201d button on Creation and give it another try? No, instead, we see the Almighty\u2019s commitment to us. According to the Apostle Paul, that commitment was made before the first act of Creation. Adam and Eve don\u2019t have to sin. They&#8217;re created to live forever and to enjoy constant fellowship with their Maker. However, before the very first \u201cLet there be light\u201d words are spoken the Lord has considered the possibly that if he makes beings with free will that that they might just reject him. What will he do if that happens? Out in pre-creation eternity the Lord decided that, no matter what happens, he\u2019ll remain committed to his Creation. Before the first moment of time, he has a plan to \u201cseek and to save that which was lost.\u201d When we hear him calling \u201cWhere are you?\u201d we\u2019re witnessing the very first step in that plan to restore the broken relationship that now exists between God and humanity. It\u2019s the first step, and in the distant future, we see a cross.<br \/>\nTake away: God wants more than obedience from me\u2026more, he wants to be in a relationship with me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Come out, come out, wherever you are Genesis 3: God called to the Man: \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I\u2019m created for fellowship with God.
