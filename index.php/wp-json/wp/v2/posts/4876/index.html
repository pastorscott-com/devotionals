The Lord blessed David for having that vision but he told David, \u201cno.\u201d  David obediently yielded but the vision never faded.  Now, late in his life David begins stockpiling materials for the great Temple project.  There\u2019s now a huge store of gold and silver and other precious building materials.  David has also identified gifted stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and artisans.  He\u2019s still on the throne but he\u2019s preparing for the day when his son Solomon ascends to leadership in Israel.  The King has a father-son chat with his son, expressing his great disappointment in not being allowed to build the Temple, but also describing for Solomon all the preparations he\u2019s made for its construction.  Obviously, David wants Solomon to be infected with his vision.  Worthwhile visions are, indeed, infectious.  My enthusiasm is passed on to others who may actually accomplish more with it than I ever could.  Also, David\u2019s preparation efforts did a lot to assure that it would come to pass.  David did more than dream of a Temple; he also did everything he could to prepare for its construction.  Without that key ingredient all we have is good intentions.  Visionary thinking includes not only thinking big, it includes real life preparation, and an intentional effort at vision casting.<br \/>\nTake Away: All the vision in the world is worthless without real life application.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Passing the vision along 1 Chronicles 22: I wanted in the worst way to build a sanctuary to honor my God.
