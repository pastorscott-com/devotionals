They know that when they became Christians that they left much of their old life behind, becoming new people. They have some practical concerns about how their faith impacts their new life. For instance, if a person was single when they came to Christ, are they to remain single? How about believers who are married to unbelievers? Is it better to abandon their marriage rather than be married to a person who doesn\u2019t share their faith? Paul\u2019s answer is \u201cwhere you are right now is God\u2019s place for you.\u201d He leans toward singles staying single, but doesn\u2019t command it. He leans toward people who are married to unbelievers remaining married, but doesn\u2019t command it. An individual can be a Christian in a wide variety of circumstances. Common sense tells us that this isn\u2019t always the case. For instance, a bigamist needs to come clean and find the best route out of an impossible situation. However, in general, we can live our lives in Christ right where we are. Beyond the marriage and divorce questions there\u2019s a solid principle here that I can take to the bank. It\u2019s wrong for me to think, \u201cRight now the circumstances of my life make it unreasonable for me to be a Christian. When things change, then I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d If living for the Lord doesn\u2019t work where I am right now it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Right here and right now the Lord stands ready to live in me and through me.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: God loves to work in ordinary lives in ordinary circumstances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bloom where you\u2019re planted 1Corinthians 7: Where you are right now is God\u2019s place for you.
