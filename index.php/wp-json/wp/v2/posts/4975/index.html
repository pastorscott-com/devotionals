His desire to join the returned exiles in Jerusalem is infectious. Several Jewish families are ready to join him in this great adventure. Beyond that, Artaxerxes the king becomes excited about the project and gives Ezra all the support needed for him to go to Jerusalem, to rule there, and to oversee the worship of Jehovah God there. Even people who aren&#8217;t relocating to Jerusalem make generous donations. Ezra puts out word that the great caravan will be formed at the Ahava Canal and people begin to gather. At first a few, then more, and then a great flood of people come, all with their families and their belongings. Suddenly Ezra realizes what an undertaking this is. In some ways he\u2019s like Moses about to lead the people to the Promised Land. They have hundreds of miles to travel across sometimes desolate and lawless territory. He knows he ought to ask for a military escort, but can&#8217;t bring himself to do that because he&#8217;s told Artaxerxes how God&#8217;s hand is on his people and how God blesses and protects those who serve him. At this point Ezra decides he must practice what he preaches. Instead of calling for soldiers he calls for a fast. Before beginning this possibly perilous journey, they\u2019ll call on the Name of the Lord asking for his guidance and protection. I think that not only is the king impressed by Ezra&#8217;s trust in the Lord, but that God is pleased too. Decades earlier the ancestors of these exiles had turned to military alliances with Egypt and other nations when faced with great danger. Ezra gets this enterprise started on the right foot: he calls on God.<br \/>\nTake Away: Better to have the protection of the Lord than to be surrounded by all the armies of the earth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Putting your money where your mouth is Ezra 8: I proclaimed a fast there beside the Ahava Canal.
