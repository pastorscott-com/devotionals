Pharaoh\u2019s known as the leader of a country with a world class economy and he intends to keep his free labor force.  He also likes getting his own way.  Mix all that with his having a hard, dispassionate disposition and we have a recipe for a long struggle.  Moses eases into the negotiations by asking that the people be given three days off for worship and Pharaoh responds by increasing the workload on the people.  The result is that Moses is disappointed and the Hebrew people are upset with him for making life harder on them than it was before.  Of course, this is the first step in what will be an epic deliverance.  For now though, the whole thing feels like a pitiful failure.  The thing is that most great events have less than stellar beginnings.  For instance, there\u2019s the story of the founding of my own nation which is filled with several \u201cone step forward and two steps back\u201d situations.  Or consider the story of the Wright brothers and human flight.  A person watching their early efforts might have concluded that they were crazy rather than visionary.  In the passage before us today, Moses appears to have totally failed in his mission.  However, he has one thing going for him that assures a positive outcome: the Lord is with him.  What has happened thus far may not look like much of a rescue mission, but the Lord is just getting started.<br \/>\nTake Away: Great miracles often begin with what seems to be pitiful failure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Big events with small beginnings Exodus 5: Does this look like rescue to you?
