God intends to do one thing, but then, in response to what they do, he changes his mind and does something else.  This view of God challenges our thinking about who he is and how he works in this world.  The Lord&#8217;s willing to be influenced by what we say and do.  Of course, in this case, this is what he wanted to have happen.  Had God only wanted to destroy them we&#8217;d have no story of Jonah and the big fish.  Instead, we&#8217;d have another Sodom and Gomorrah story about fire and brimstone wiping out a sinful city.  The reluctant prophet is sent on this mission exactly because God wants their lives to change.  This is a classic Old Testament prophet situation.  The prophet says, \u201cIf you do this, God&#8217;s going to do that&#8230;if you do that, God&#8217;s going to do this.\u201d  The Lord\u2019s message to Nineveh is that, because of their sin, destruction is coming.  However, even though it&#8217;s unspoken, they&#8217;re also being given a choice.  If sin is bringing destruction, repentance will bring life.  When the people of Nineveh make the right choice God is happy to change his mind.  This kind of thinking opens up all kinds of possibilities for us.  When I pray, asking for God\u2019s intervention in some matter, I\u2019m not just going through a spiritual discipline.  Rather, I\u2019m actually being allowed to influence God!  My standing in this world is much more than my traveling some predetermined path to some predetermined conclusion.  I\u2019m a partner with God who&#8217;s allowing me to work with him in changing the world.  Here\u2019s a view of a God who&#8217;s never at a loss; who always knows what he&#8217;ll do in response to what I do of my own free will.  Such a view doesn\u2019t make God less.  Instead, it makes him more.  He&#8217;s God whatever happens.<br \/>\nTake Away: As his people we\u2019re partners with the Lord who allows us to work with him in changing the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The God of whatever happens Jonah 3: God&#8230;did change his mind about them.
