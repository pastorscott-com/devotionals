Usually the most prominent feature is now long these leaders ruled; around 22 years on the average.

These folks quietly go about living their lives under the authority of the Lord God and lead their people in faithful worship of him. Today, I thank God for people like that and I\u2019m reminded that without spectacular spiritual failure we don&#8217;t need to have as many stories of miraculous divine rescues.<br \/>\nTake Away: Good leadership sometimes means no big stories, no disasters, just lives quietly lived&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good old boredom Judges 10: After him, Jair the Gileadite stepped into leadership.
