When I hear the phrase: &#8220;God&#8217;s Word&#8221; I always assume that it\u2019s the Bible that\u2019s being talked about.  David, who thought of the written word of God as the Torah, reminds me that &#8220;God&#8217;s Word&#8221; is much more than written words making up a leather-bound book or a rare and valuable scroll.  He says that Creation, itself, is the &#8220;Word of God.&#8221;  Whether I am watching the sunrise or a starlit nighttime sky I\u2019m reading God&#8217;s message of love and goodwill to me and to all human beings.  These things, David says, are roadmaps to God&#8230;roadmaps with easy to follow directions.  Of course, beyond the written Word, or the Word displayed in Creation, is the Living Word of God: God the Son, Jesus.  David only has a dim, distant knowledge of the Word in the Flesh.  Still, even lacking that, he keeps seeing God everywhere he looks.  In all of life, God is speaking; I just need to learn to listen on a broader scale that I might more fully hear his message to me.<br \/>\nTake Away: If we pay attention we\u2019ll hear from God in a wonderful variety of ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seeing God, everywhere Psalm 19: God&#8217;s glory is on tour in the skies.
