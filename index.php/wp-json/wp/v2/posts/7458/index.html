For some time now Israel had heard nothing but condemnation from God&#8217;s prophet, Ezekiel.  According to him things are going to get worse before they get better.  Now, we see that things will, indeed, get better.  The same man who&#8217;s condemned their sin and the sins of the nations associated with them is going to be given a different word from the Lord.  His words will bring hope and deliverance.  His messages will reconnect them with God, himself.  What powerful words they&#8217;re going to be!  These aren\u2019t the empty promises of a politician.  This is God&#8217;s man speaking God&#8217;s word to them.  When the Lord gets involved words take on an additional element of power.  As a preacher I&#8217;m both encouraged and challenged here.  I&#8217;m encouraged that, as old fashioned as it might seem, that God can communicate to people through a weak vessel like me and that as I preach God can &#8220;stir up fresh hope&#8221; and usher in &#8220;deliverance&#8221; in people&#8217;s lives.  I&#8217;m challenged to live close enough to the Lord that he can direct me in that endeavor; to trust him and cooperate with him in what he wants to say to those who are listening.<br \/>\nTake Away: Words directed by the Lord are powerful and can be life changing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A good word from the Lord Ezekiel 29: I&#8217;ll give you, Ezekiel, bold and confident words to speak.
