Well, come to think of it, \u201ccame out of\u201d is too strong a phrase. When the immorality of their society comes knocking at the church door, they make little effort to keep it out. One of the church members, Paul is told, is involved in sexual immorality. There\u2019s also rude behavior, drunkenness, greed, and dishonesty. In other words, the insiders are acting a whole lot like the outsiders. How does this happen? I think the Christians at Corinth, being around such behavior every day, are dangerously comfortable with sin. When it appears in their number, rather than be horrified by it, they brush it off. Before the dentist does some drilling, the patient receives an injection that numbs the area. Otherwise, the work would cause great pain. In Corinth, the Christians have been \u201cnumbed\u201d by their constant association with sin. Rather than be horrified by its appearance in their number they shrug it off. What a warning for us! The same immorality that&#8217;s rampant in Corinth is rampant in our society. Every day we wade through this cesspool. If we aren\u2019t careful and if we don\u2019t stay very close to Christ we\u2019re desensitized to its awfulness. Oh Lord, as we encounter sin out in the world, help us to see it for what it is. When we see it in the church, let it break our hearts. If we find it in our hearts, let it drive us to our knees in repentance.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Jesus prayed that we\u2019d be in the world but not of it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living in an immoral society 1Corinthians 5: Shouldn\u2019t this break your hearts?
