His words remind me of some of the Psalms of complaint when David thought it was all over for him. In words similar to what David used, Paul describes how he was crushed and sure that he was at the end. In his despair he realized he was out of options and that there was nothing he could do to save himself. At that low point, he remembered his greatest Resource. When he came to the end of himself he found himself at just the beginning of God. Throwing himself on the mercy of God is the smartest thing he ever did. After all, Paul reminds us, this is the God who even raises the dead. The Lord was equal to the challenge and, for Paul, the sun rose once again in his life, giving him a new lease on life. This journey to death\u2019s door and back, Paul says, has turned out to be a positive event in his life. These days he\u2019s quicker to stop struggling and to start trusting in God to bring about a rescue in his life. This is a lesson I need to learn anew. I serve a God who loves me and who has the power to, when necessary, raise the dead. I may not like it when life brings me my share of uncertainty and even pain. At the same time, I can remember that the same God who has brought me through difficult times in the past can \u201crescue me as many times as I need rescuing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: In an uncertain world the Lord remains my steadfast certainty.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the end of myself and at the beginning of God 2Corinthians 1: And he\u2019ll do it again, rescuing us as many times as we need rescuing.
