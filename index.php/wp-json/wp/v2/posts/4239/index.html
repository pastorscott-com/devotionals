Everything from the frame of the Tent of Meeting to the Ark of the Covenant to the clothing of those who will serve has been crafted precisely to God\u2019s design.  Moses inspects the work and sees that it has been done well.  Then he blesses them.  Sometimes, the job of the leader is to point people in the right direction and then get out of the way while they do what they&#8217;re gifted to do.  However, the leader\u2019s job isn\u2019t over at that point, in fact, that&#8217;s just one of a pair of \u201cleadership bookends.\u201d  The other bookend is found in Moses blessing the workers at the end of their task.  Leaders are to lead in appreciation as well as vision.  As a pastor, I often point people in the right direction, whether they&#8217;re singers or electricians.  Both are doing things that are beyond my capability and I certainly can\u2019t micromanage their efforts.  However, once the job is done, it&#8217;s my job to be the \u201clead appreciator\u201d in the church.   Every leader needs to be an expert in showing appreciation for the efforts of those we lead.<br \/>\nTake Away: A real leader knows how to lead in public appreciation of others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leadership bookends Exodus 39: Moses saw that they had done all the work and done it exactly as God had commanded.
