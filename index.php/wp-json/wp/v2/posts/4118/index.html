He\u2019s gone from being the favorite son to being a lowly slave.  His intelligence, honesty, and God\u2019s blessing put him on the fast track in Potiphar\u2019s household, but he\u2019s still a slave, a piece of property.  When Mrs. Potiphar becomes infatuated with him Joseph refuses to play along.  There\u2019ll be no fling with the boss\u2019s wife for him.  Joseph doesn\u2019t need Moses or Laws written in stone to tell him that that would be a betrayal of Potiphar and a sin against God.  Even though Mrs. Potiphar doesn\u2019t like Joseph\u2019s insistence on sexual purity he stands his ground (well, better put: he flees as fast as his feet will carry him!).  I\u2019m impressed with this young man who takes his commitment to God seriously even in the face of sexual opportunity.  For him, he\u2019ll hold to God\u2019s beautiful standard of sex only within marriage.  As we see in this story, and as we see in the lives of people today, individuals who have standards and hold to them are in a position to be especially blessed by God and to be a blessing to others.<br \/>\nTake away: God can use people who hold to his standards.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hell hath no fury&#8230; Genesis 39: How could I violate his trust and sin against God?
