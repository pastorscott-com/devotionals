They defeat the inhabitants and take over their territory.  Now, it\u2019s time for the next generation to make preparations for the campaign to take Canaan.  Two of the tribes come to Moses requesting that they be allowed to forfeit their portion of the Promised Land and settle right where they are.  Moses is livid.  He sees this as the prelude of another failure on the part of the Israelites to obey the Lord and to move forward to the land they were promised long ago.  The people of Ruben and Gad respond that they\u2019ll join the fight and help their fellow Israelites take the land but that they\u2019ll be happy with right where they are.  Moses agrees but warns them that they\u2019ll have to keep their part of the bargain.   As good as that land east of Canaan might have been, I think Ruben and Gad made a huge error.  They settled for \u201calmost Canaan\u201d instead of Canaan, itself.  No matter how good that area was it wasn\u2019t what the Lord had for them.  It was good, but it wasn\u2019t the best.  This kind of compromise is always a temptation for us.  We shouldn\u2019t let so called human wisdom serve as a substitute to God\u2019s call and promise on our lives.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t settle for merely good when the Lord offers us the very best.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Settling for God\u2019s second best Numbers 32: Don\u2019t make us go across the Jordan After the failure of the Israelites to cross into Canaan the Lord gives them temporary possession of the land to the east.
