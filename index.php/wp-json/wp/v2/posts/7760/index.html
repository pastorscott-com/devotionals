There won\u2019t be many people left, but those who are left will be clean in God\u2019s sight. However, even those who are dispersed among the nations won\u2019t be tossed aside and forgotten. There\u2019s redemption even in their situation. In the end, the redeemed people of Israel will be reunited and their long exile will come to an end. With that in mind, I see that, ultimately, Judgment Day yields to Homecoming Day. The Day of Judgment isn\u2019t all about punishment. Rather, it\u2019s part of the Lord\u2019s plan to reconcile the lost to him. The little book of Zephaniah ends, not with wailing and gnashing of teeth, but instead with reunions and celebration. I can learn from this passage. The end-of-the-world Judgment Day is surely something for which to prepare. However, in the big picture, it\u2019s the event necessary to usher in something wonderful for all of God\u2019s people.<br \/>\nTake Away: The plan of the Lord is to unite all who will come with one another and with himself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After Judgment Day comes Homecoming Day Zephaniah 3: On Judgment Day I\u2019ll bring you back home.
