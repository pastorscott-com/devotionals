Who will go for us?<br \/>\nIsaiah&#8217;s vision of God brings him face to face with God&#8217;s holiness and his own uncleanness.  However, his cry for mercy is heard, and through the symbolism of fire from the altar, we see true cleansing for this man of God.  Now here\u2019s his commission.  Immediately, I\u2019m reminded of the need for &#8220;sent people&#8221; in the Kingdom of God.  The need is great, and, as Jesus said, &#8220;The workers are few.&#8221;  The Lord wants to touch every life on the planet in wonderful ways, but workers must be willing to go and work in the harvest.  Also, we see that just any worker won\u2019t do.  The call comes after the cleansing, or, maybe as a part of it.  A cleansed heart seeks only that which pleases the master while the carnal heart is divided between what self wants and what God wants.  A soldier who filters every order he or she receives, deciding whether or not he or she really wants to obey isn&#8217;t going to be very effective in the heat of the battle.  The call of God to go is for those who\u2019ve died out to self and been purified by the work of the Lord.  Finally, there must be absolute willingness on the part of the one called.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t force Isaiah out into the difficult ministry to which he\u2019s to give his life.  Isaiah&#8217;s free will isn\u2019t compromised.  The call goes out for workers and Isaiah willingly steps forward with, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go. Send me!&#8221;  Workers in God&#8217;s Kingdom are servants of the Lord, but we aren&#8217;t in bondage.  We serve gladly and willingly.<br \/>\nTake Away: Workers in God&#8217;s Kingdom are servants of the Lord, but we aren&#8217;t in bondage.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cleansed and called and sent Isaiah 6: Whom shall I send?
