It\u2019s instructive to note that Moses didn\u2019t go out to that place on a spiritual retreat in an attempt to find God.  Instead, the Lord finds him, getting his attention in a unique, unforgettable way.  It\u2019s the Lord who calls out to Moses as he called out to Adam and Eve in the Garden and as he will call out to the boy Samuel many years hence.  Moses is shocked to hear his own name being called out from that burning bush and he instinctively draws closer.  However, the Lord stops him, telling him to remove his shoes because he\u2019s now on \u201choly ground.\u201d  Obviously, it\u2019s the Presence of the Lord in that place that makes, what would otherwise be just dirt, into something sacred.  In many cultures today, shoe removal is an act of respect or reverence.  The command that Moses remove his sandals isn\u2019t a brand new idea to Moses; it\u2019s just that he\u2019s in a holy place and at first, didn\u2019t realize it.  It should come as no surprise that the Lord likes to come into our lives in unexpected ways!  He\u2019s been doing that since the very beginning.  At first, I may miss what\u2019s happening altogether but as soon as it dawns on me that God has come close, I\u2019m to reverently respond; realizing that, what I thought was common has been sanctified by his presence.<br \/>\nTake Away: Where ever I encounter God that place becomes for me, holy ground.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exodus 3: You\u2019re standing on holy ground.
