However, it\u2019s not long before Ezra learns that there\u2019s a big problem. The Jews already in the area have intermingled with the other peoples of the area to the point of intermarrying. This is a clear violation of the Law of God and Ezra\u2019s devastated by such blatant failure. He came to Jerusalem to teach people who he believed wanted to learn how to worship God. He assumed that they were already the &#8220;people of God&#8221; and that they only needed someone to teach them how to live as the people of God. Now he finds that they\u2019ve broken the covenant with the Lord in the most basic way by allowing themselves to be absorbed into the cultures around them. Ezra mourns this situation and then begins to pray. Here&#8217;s the thing: his prayer isn\u2019t for &#8220;them&#8221; as much as it\u2019s for &#8220;us.&#8221; Their sin, in his eyes is shared by all of their people and his prayer is a corporate prayer. How often do I pray that way? I pray about &#8220;those&#8221; bad people who are attacking and tearing down moral values in my society and I pray that I might be protected from &#8220;those&#8221; evil people who would do me and those I love harm. There\u2019s a time and a place for such prayers, but, taking my cue from Ezra, there\u2019s also a place for corporate confession. Ezra isn&#8217;t married a heathen woman, yet he comes to God &#8220;totally ashamed&#8221; by this breaking of God\u2019s Law. He tells the Lord, &#8220;We have thrown your commands to the wind&#8221; and confesses that &#8220;we&#8221; are &#8220;openly guilty.&#8221; As he prays this prayer of confession others began to weep and repent \u2013 others who have actually done the sinning! Here, I think, is the power of genuine intercession. Ezra identifies himself with their sin and then, they identify themselves with his repentance.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s power in intercessory prayer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The power of intercessory prayer Ezra 9: My dear God, I&#8217;m so totally ashamed, I can&#8217;t bear to face you.
