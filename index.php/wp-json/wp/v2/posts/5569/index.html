But I, God, search the heart and examine the mind.  I get to the heart of the human.  I get to the root of things.  I treat them as they really are, not as they pretend to be.&#8221;  There\u2019s much of our humanity that we humans can&#8217;t figure out.  I may do something and then wonder why I did it or I may state a position and then realize that my reasons are not as clear as I thought they were.  Jeremiah tells me that the heart of my life is a dark place.  If you look at the passage again, you&#8217;ll see that he isn&#8217;t talking so much about darkness as &#8220;wickedness&#8221; (although I do think we\u2019re sinners by nature and need to let the Lord deal with that aspect of our lives) as he is talking about &#8220;mysterious.&#8221;  In other words, Jeremiah points out that our lives are a tangled web of desires, hopes, hurts, and misconceptions.  Finding one&#8217;s way through all that is like navigating a maze at night.  In a word: impossible.  However, the Lord can find his way to the core of issues within me.  He searches my innermost being, getting to the root of why I am the person I am.  So what do I take away from this concept?  For one thing, I see that I&#8217;m not qualified to judge others.  I can&#8217;t untangle their lives so I had better leave the judging up to the One who can.  Also, I come away from this passage reminded of how important it is that I rely on, and listen to, the Lord.  He unravels the mystery of my life.  Sometimes, he sees my failure and, looking through all the darkness, says, &#8220;That&#8217;s okay.  You did your best, I judge you &#8216;not guilty.'&#8221;  It may be though, that he\u2019ll say, &#8220;what you did was plain sin.  You rebelled against me and even though you can make surface excuses, I know better.  Repent and make it right.&#8221;  He knows me better than I know myself as he navigates to the very core of my being.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord knows me better than I know myself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Navigating through a maze at night Jeremiah 17: The heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful.
