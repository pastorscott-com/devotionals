He\u2019s been set free from sin\u2019s prison and now wants to live God\u2019s way.  He understands that God\u2019s ways are right but under the influence of sin even the purity of the Law becomes a tool of temptation and failure.  He\u2019s been freed from prison but some of that prison remains in him.  He declares \u201cI need something more.\u201d  A believer doesn\u2019t have to attend a particular brand of church to identify with this statement.  Having been forgiven of sins I set out to live a new life of righteousness in fellowship with the Lord.  However, I come to the conclusion that this isn\u2019t as easy as it appears.  In fact, the harder I try to live that life of righteousness the clearer it becomes that, in Paul\u2019s words: \u201cI obviously need help!\u201d  Is this passage a pitiful surrender to sin?  When all is said and done, is the Christian life all about grimly holding on through repeated spiritual failure?  The Apostle will more fully answer these questions as he continues writing in what we call chapter eight, but he tips his hand when he says, \u201cThe answer, thank God, is&#8230;Jesus Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Without the deeper work of God the Christian life is one of constant struggle.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The greatest need of the believer Romans 7: But I need something more.
