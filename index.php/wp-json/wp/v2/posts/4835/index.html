On one side is Egypt and on the other is Babylon. Like some small island out in the Pacific during the Second World War, this small nation is thrust onto the world stage, not because of its military might, but simply because of its location. Upon Josiah&#8217;s untimely death the nation struggles for its identity. Sadly, it is Josiah&#8217;s reforms that lose favor. Soon, the nation is once again on the road to spiritual and national disaster. Raiding bands begin to assault Judah as the two big players on the world scene fight it out. It\u2019s Babylon that wins. Following the &#8220;conquer and relocate&#8221; policy of Assyria before them the people of Jerusalem are relocated to a distant land with only the poor left to be ruled by a puppet king. The writer of 2nd Kings tells us that no one should have been surprised. For over 300 years they\u2019ve been warned that God isn\u2019t some kind of lucky charm for them. They mistakenly thought that being the &#8220;people of God&#8221; meant that, ultimately, they would be safe. They thought that because of Josiah&#8217;s reforms they were inoculated against failure. Because of the patience and mercy of God over the years, they downplayed the warnings they were given again and again. Finally though, things happened just as God had said they would. I\u2019m reminded today that God isn&#8217;t kidding when he says he\u2019ll judge sin. It\u2019s a dangerous thing to mistake the patience of God with his not being serious in what he says.<br \/>\nTake Away: Don\u2019t mistake the patience of the Lord for a lack of seriousness on his part.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mistaking God\u2019s patience for a lack of seriousness 2Kings 25: This should have been no surprise &#8212; God had said it would happen.
