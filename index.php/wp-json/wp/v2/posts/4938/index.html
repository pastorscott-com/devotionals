By and large, he does a good job as king and his long reign is a good one for his nation. From the beginning he seeks God. The Lord is pleased with him and blesses his life with successful building projects and a strong army. Then, when it seems Uzziah will be one of the rare kings who have nothing but positive things on their record something ugly happens. His successes go to Uzziah\u2019s head. We don\u2019t know the full story but Uzziah decides, like Saul did many generations earlier, to take over the worship activities. He takes the one role in the nation that&#8217;s denied him \u2013 going into the Temple and acting as priest of God. The legitimate priests, descendants of Aaron, try to stop Uzziah, but he ignores them. With the holy censor in hand, he refuses to hear the objections of the priests. Then, God objects, and when he objects, he can\u2019t be ignored. The dreaded disease of leprosy breaks out on Uzziah\u2019s hand as he holds the censor. This is God\u2019s judgment. It\u2019s too bad isn\u2019t it. Uzziah comes so far and does so many things right. His downfall comes, not as a result of some big temptation or some great threat. Instead, it\u2019s brought about by his success. When things are going right and it\u2019s clear that God is blessing us we need to remember Uzziah. Here we see a lesson in how success can lead to failure.<br \/>\nTake Away: The distance from impressive success to dismal failure is shorter than we might think.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pride goes before a fall 2 Chronicles 26: Arrogant and proud, he fell.
