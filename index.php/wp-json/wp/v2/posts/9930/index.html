His dealing with the Romans is unsavory in the eyes of most people and tax collectors are viewed as being dishonest, taking advantage of others.  We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s more to the story, but his transition from collecting taxes to following Jesus happens in one sentence here in the book of the Bible that bears Matthew\u2019s name.  Jesus invites and Matthew stands up and follows.  Later on, Matthew throws a party in honor of our Lord.  Having followed Jesus for less than a day poor Matthew doesn\u2019t have any \u201cinsider\u201d friends.  All he has is \u201coutsider\u201d friends; others who are looked down on by the \u201cright\u201d sort of people.  Matthew invites them all to come to this event where they, too, can meet Jesus.  The religious leaders can\u2019t believe their eyes.  All their suspicions about Jesus are confirmed.  He can\u2019t tell the difference between good and bad people.  In fact, he\u2019s too at home with the wrong sort of people.  Know what?  Jesus is right at home with them.  However, the question to ask is, \u201cWhy are we followers of Jesus so uncomfortable around sinners?\u201d  Jesus loved them, enjoyed their company, and offered them a better way.  I fear that we church people have more in common with the religious leaders than we do with Jesus.  We isolate and insulate ourselves inside our church buildings.  We read our Christian books and go to our Christian movies and listen to our Christian radio stations.  We have Christian softball and bowling leagues.  When the pastor urges us to bring our unsaved friends to church we shrug our shoulders and declare that we don\u2019t have any.  Maybe the church world needs to add \u201cbefriend a sinner\u201d week to our busy church calendars.  <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We can\u2019t bring light to the world if we spend all our time hidden behind closed church doors.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guess who\u2019s coming to dinner?
