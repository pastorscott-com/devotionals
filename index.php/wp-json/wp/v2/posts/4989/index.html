One is to post guards to keep watch. The other is to organize prayer. This reliance on prayer isn\u2019t unusual for Nehemiah at all. Often we find him responding to problems by praying. While posting guards is a practical thing to do, I think the most practical thing he does is to pray. I tend to treat prayer as a last ditch effort to be used when all else has failed, or something to be done by people who are unable for some reason to get involved in the &#8220;real work.&#8221; Know what? It\u2019s prayer that\u2019s the real work. Nehemiah goes ahead and arms the workers for self-defense but the attack never comes. The reason is that he and his team first countered the threat with prayer.
