He relies on the love of a mother for her baby to reveal which of the two women is the baby&#8217;s mother. It\u2019s a pretty impressive display of wisdom, but only the first. In the pages to come we repeatedly see examples of Solomon\u2019s wisdom. Clearly, God keeps his word and gives Solomon the wisdom he so wisely asked for. I like this statement that says people are in awe of Solomon but they also recognize that his wisdom is directly from God. In the New Testament it\u2019s James who talks about wisdom. He says that if I lack wisdom I should ask God who will freely give it. I don&#8217;t know if James is thinking about Solomon or not, but as I put these two things together I conclude that God\u2019s in the wisdom giving business, willingly helping me make good decisions as I cooperate with him. This, my friend, is a pretty good deal. I find myself in need of wisdom and here I\u2019m reminded that there\u2019s a Source of wisdom available.<br \/>\nTake Away: Maybe we should pray for wisdom more often and concerning more things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What a wise guy! 1Kings 3: They were all in awe of the king, realizing that it was God&#8217;s wisdom that enabled him to judge truly.
