It\u2019s this good man that Abraham sends on a very important mission. The reason we aren\u2019t absolutely certain that it\u2019s Eliezer being spoken of in this passage is that he&#8217;s unnamed in the narrative. Even when he introduces himself to Rebekah\u2019s family, he identifies himself as \u201cthe servant of Abraham.\u201d I consider Eliezer to be one of the most admirable little-known people of the Bible. Here\u2019s a man who\u2019s dedicated to Abraham, who knows how to pray, and is entrusted with the most delicate of tasks. He humbly accepts the mission and then believes the Lord will help him accomplish it. I pray that the Lord will see me as a sort of Eliezer in his Kingdom. I\u2019ll gladly let other more capable people have the starring roles in accomplishing the Lord\u2019s purposes in this world if he\u2019ll use me to quietly go about serving him in ways for which I\u2019m best suited. Once in a while, I\u2019ll feel especially honored if he trusts me to do some especially sensitive task.<br \/>\nTake away: It\u2019s an honor to be used of God to do things that go largely unnoticed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abraham\u2019s servant Genesis 24: Go to the land of my birth and get a wife for my son Isaac.
