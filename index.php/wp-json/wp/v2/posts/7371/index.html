Now, as Jerusalem totters on the brink of destruction Jeremiah seeks him out.  The Lord has a message specifically for this hero, and it\u2019s a good one.  The Lord has taken note of this good man&#8217;s courage and faithfulness.  Things are going to get really bad very soon but Ebed-melek is going to be spared because God&#8217;s going to see to it.  In a sense, we see here God&#8217;s message to all those who are faithful to him.  There&#8217;s no promise for any of us of an easy life in which bad things never come, but there is the promise of God&#8217;s watch care over us.  It must have been, at the same time, welcome and unbelievable news for Ebed-melek.  Of course, he&#8217;s happy to hear such a message from Jeremiah, God&#8217;s prophet.  At the same time, he, and all Jerusalem, is very aware of the mighty army that&#8217;s poised on their doorstep.  The reality of it all nearly overwhelms the message of assurance from Jeremiah.  It&#8217;s the same for you and me.  The hard facts of pain and disappointment and disaster can nearly obliterate the promise of God&#8217;s presence.  Still, none of that negates it.  Interestingly, the writer of the sacred text doesn&#8217;t follow up on the story.  Jeremiah promises Ebed-melek that God will save him and that&#8217;s it.  Maybe there&#8217;s a lesson for us in what isn&#8217;t included here.  We&#8217;re to read this promise and conclude that, even though we don&#8217;t know the details, God keeps his word.  In the same way, I, right in the middle of life without any specific knowledge of what&#8217;s coming, must conclude that God will &#8220;most certainly save&#8221; me too.<br \/>\nTake Away: Even we don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to do it we can rest assured that the Lord will, indeed, keep his promises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taking the \u201crest of the story\u201d by faith Jeremiah 39: I&#8217;ll most certainly save you.
