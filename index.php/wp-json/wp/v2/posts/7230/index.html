Isaiah looks to such a day, a day when the people of God will reflect God in their lives.  Of course, that reflection is incomplete.  Even as the bright moon reflects the sun, but not the entirety of the sun, so do God\u2019s people reflect the holiness of God.  Isaiah promises a day and a people who\u2019ll walk the Holy Road and in that journey will &#8220;be becoming&#8221; the people God intends them to be.  To walk that road is, at the same time, a journey and a destination.  That is, the journey is what the Lord calls us to.  To him, &#8220;arriving&#8221; is not nearly as important as &#8220;journeying.&#8221;  With that in mind we respond to his call on our lives, the call to holiness, and thus get on the Holy Road.  Starting is not the same thing as finishing, but without the start and without the steadfastness of the journey there\u2019s no hope of arrival.  Holiness people are people committed to that journey, not people who have finished it.<br \/>\nTake Away: We are a people on a journey, not people who have reached a destination.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wouldn\u2019t take nothing for my journey now Isaiah 35: There will be a highway called the Holy Road.
