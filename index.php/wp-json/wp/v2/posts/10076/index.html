He loves this church.  They\u2019re his dear friends.  In fact, he considers them to be his children in Christ.  At the same time he\u2019s frustrated with the smallness of their lives.  The infighting, bickering, competing attitude of theirs not only breaks his heart but it also limits their view of God and what he does in people\u2019s lives.  Without reservation Paul has given himself to them and to the Church in general.  He\u2019s suffered physically for it but at the same time he\u2019s been blessed beyond description.  If the Corinthians feel their religion puts them in a straightjacket it\u2019s their own fault.  There\u2019s so much more to being a Christian than trying to be first in line at church potlucks or getting to be the one who sings the special song. Paul calls them to a better way: a passionate life lived joyfully for the Lord.  These words speak to church people throughout the ages.  Am I going to make church about meetings and rules and authority or am I going to make it about living passionately for the Lord?  The first binds and limits me.  The second sets me free to live \u201copenly and expansively.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: The Christian life isn\u2019t binding \u2013 rather, it\u2019s wonderfully freeing.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living unreservedly for God 2Corinthians 6: The smallness you feel comes from within you.
