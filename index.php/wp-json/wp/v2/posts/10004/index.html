He warns them that the same people who hate him will hate them.  That hate won\u2019t be about them as much as it will be about Jesus.  His disciples will be so much like their Lord that those who hated him without cause will hate them without cause.  Jesus also encourages them to be \u201cat home\u201d in his love.  What an interesting phrase.  To be at home is to feel secure and comfortable.  It\u2019s to be with family and friends, giving support and receiving the same.  Jesus tells his followers to enjoy that kind of comfort in his love.  He\u2019s committed to love us even though he already knows our weaknesses and failings.  While it\u2019s true that I stand amazed in his love it\u2019s also true that I have every reason to depend on it and to relax in it.  So, there you have it.  Out in the world we\u2019re strangers, treated unfairly by people who don\u2019t even know why it is that they don\u2019t like us.  On the other hand, we\u2019re upheld by the undeserved, beyond-understanding love of Christ.  All in all, it\u2019s a pretty good situation.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I want to be comfortable in the love of Christ.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Love and hate John 15: Make yourselves at home in my love.
