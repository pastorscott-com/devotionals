He comes to the Lord and lays it all on the table, confessing his confusion and disappointment.  He knows God to be righteous and loving but what he sees happening has none of that in it.  The godless army of Babylon is destroying God\u2019s chosen people and that doesn\u2019t make sense to Habakkuk.  Not only that, but his prayers go unanswered.  Why, of all times, does the Almighty choose this dark hour to go silent?  Where is God when evil is winning the day?  Does God\u2019s use of unrighteous people to achieve his purposes make God, himself, unrighteous?  Habakkuk writes more on this topic, including a report on how God finally responds to his questions.  However, today I\u2019m taken with how he goes into the presence of the Lord to state his fear and disappointment.  There\u2019s something refreshing about Habakkuk\u2019s approach to the Lord here.  Habakkuk isn\u2019t irreverent toward the Almighty, but he openly expresses his disappointment in how the Lord is doing (maybe better, isn\u2019t doing) things at this point.  I know I\u2019m called to trust the Lord no matter what, but if I\u2019m having doubts the Lord wants me to bring them to him.  To pretend I believe when I don\u2019t does me no good and is dissatisfying to the Lord as well.<br \/>\nTake Away: Better to victoriously march on in overcoming faith but when there is doubt we can be frankly honest with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Telling it like it is Habakkuk 1: Why are you silent now?
