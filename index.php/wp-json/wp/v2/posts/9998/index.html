He began the day blind, listening to a conversation between Jesus and his disciples about himself and his pitiful condition.  Then, Jesus turns his full attention to himself.  The Lord takes common dirt, spits in it to make a sort of mud plaster, and sends him to \u201cSent Pool\u201d to wash.  He obeys and he sees!  Now, he finds himself at the heart of an inquiry being conducted by the religious leaders.   In amazing callousness they&#8217;re more interested in the fact that the healing took place on the Sabbath than they are in the healing itself.  When the once blind man is asked about his healer, he says he is a man named Jesus.  Later on, he\u2019s had time to think about what has happened, and when he\u2019s asked a second time about his healer, he upgrades him from merely being a man who made mud to proclaiming him to be a prophet of God.  Then, when he\u2019s pressed on the issue yet again, he decides his healer ought to have disciples, that he\u2019s a man from God.  Finally, when he literally sees Jesus for the first time at their second meeting, he worships him.  His journey to spiritual sight has taken multiple steps and he\u2019s now ready to worship.  Obviously, this spiritual journey is extraordinary.  Still, in this story we\u2019re reminded that people come to the Lord step by step.  Who knows?  My part in someone\u2019s journey might simply be to direct them down the block to \u201cSent Pool.\u201d  Someone else will help them at other key points of their spiritual journey.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Clearly, there is a crisis point in which people declare Jesus as \u201cMaster\u201d in their life, but there are also plenty of other less dramatic points in that journey too.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Journey to sight John 9: \u201cMaster, I believe,\u201d the man said, and worshiped him.
