King Saul is unpredictable and on the verge of losing it altogether.  He\u2019s developed a habit of sitting on his throne with his spear by his side.  If anyone displeases him in the slightest his glare tells him or her that the spear isn\u2019t just for appearances.  Even his own son, Jonathan or the hero of the land, David is not exempt.  In fact, both of these good men have barely escaped with their lives when Saul made use of the spear.  Jonathan still thinks he can handle his father but David is unconvinced and urges his best friend to test things for him.  David&#8217;s concerns are justified.  Saul&#8217;s a danger to anyone who&#8217;s in his vicinity, but especially to David.  If he\u2019s to survive it\u2019s time for David to run.  As he and Jonathan meet in preparation for David&#8217;s departure we get a glimpse into the heart of their deep friendship.  The bond is God.  They both love the Lord with all their hearts.  Both are willing to die for the Lord.  It\u2019s their relationships to God that\u2019s cemented their friendship with one another.  The best, lasting, healthiest, most satisfying relationships have, at their core, God.  This is beautifully illustrated in this passage.<br \/>\nTake Away: Where the Lord is at the core of a relationship that relationship will be marked by love.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The cement of lasting friendships 1 Samuel 20: God will be the bond between me and you, and between my children and your children forever!
