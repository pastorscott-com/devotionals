What beliefs are required to be \u201cChristian\u201d and what beliefs are outside of the boundaries of Christianity? Creeds were debated, created, and adjusted as Christians tried to better understand what was and what was not \u201cChristian.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that the main focus in all this was Jesus, himself. Who was he? What does it mean for him to be the \u201cSon of God\u201d? What does it mean for him to be the \u201cSon of man\u201d? Some people focused on his humanity and decided Jesus was a very good man who was picked by God to be the Savior of the world. Others focused on his divinity. They decided that Jesus appeared to be human, but was actually God dressed up in human flesh. Ultimately, the Church abandoned mathematics in favor of faith. It was concluded that Jesus was, at the same time 100% man and 100% God. Never mind that this adds up to 200% &#8212; we\u2019d just believe that that\u2019s how it is. Here we are, way down the road and so comfortable with this approach that we don\u2019t think much about it. Today\u2019s passage played a role in this understanding of Jesus. The writer of Hebrews describes one who was so human that he died a very human and real death for all. At the same time, he\u2019s positioned in the loftiest of realms. For human beings, this is good news indeed, it\u2019s great having one we call \u201cbrother\u201d also be our Lord and Savior.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Jesus is 100% man. He\u2019s also 100% God. This God-man is the Savior of the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My brother is King Hebrews 2: It\u2019s logical that the savior took on flesh and blood in order to rescue them by his death.
