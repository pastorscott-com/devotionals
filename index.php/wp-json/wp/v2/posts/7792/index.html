Now, in response to the urgings of Haggai and Zechariah he\u2019s ready to shoulder the task of rebuilding the Temple.  His heart, and the hearts of his people, is in the right place.  God is pleased with them.  The Lord\u2019s words to the good man and his people are wonderfully encouraging: the Temple will be rebuilt not because of some extraordinary human effort, but by the power of God\u2019s Spirit.  This doesn\u2019t mean that the governor and people can sit back and do nothing while a Temple rises from the ashes of destruction, but it does mean that the power for this project is coming from God.  The Lord is with them, not only approving of their actions but empowering them as well.  With that in mind I see here that my efforts to accomplish things in the Name of the Lord aren\u2019t limited by my own initiative, skills, or intelligence.
