In fact, he has plenty of competition from preachers who enjoy large followings and enthusiastic support.  Folks love their positive, uplifting, and encouraging sermons.  No doubt, these preachers find some really good texts that proclaim God&#8217;s love for and protection of his people.  The problem is that their sermons are, in Jeremiah&#8217;s words, just so much &#8220;hot air.&#8221;  The people in their congregations need to repent and return to God.  The truth is that everything\u2019s not going to turn out fine and bad things are coming, whether or not these preachers will admit it.  Can&#8217;t you imagine a family getting ready to go to worship services? &#8220;Where are we going to church today, dear?&#8221; the wife asks.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  Jeremiah\u2019s preaching nearby, but you know he specializes in telling it like it is.  I hear that the &#8216;Things are Great and Getting Better&#8217; church has big things planned for today and they have a terrific praise band.  Shall we go there?&#8221;  So, where would I go to church?  How entertainment oriented am I when it comes to worship?  I&#8217;m not suggesting that &#8220;gloom and doom&#8221; is always God&#8217;s message while &#8220;happiness and security&#8221; is always just hot air.  Still, I see here a reminder that there\u2019s more to worship than a main course of an entertaining sermon with large helping of great music on the side.<br \/>\nTake Away: Sometimes God-directed preaching isn\u2019t all that fun to hear.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Which church would you attend?
