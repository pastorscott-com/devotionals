Now, I&#8217;m pretty lost in the contemporary meaning of this vision.  However, I know that about 500 years from the time these words are written that a man who is Prophet, Priest, and King is going to come to this world.  These offices will be united in him and he&#8217;ll change everything.  I know Zechariah\u2019s words have meaning for the people who have returned from exile and are focused on rebuilding the Temple.  However, I think they&#8217;re also intended to lay a foundation of understanding concerning the coming of the Son of God to this world.  When the writer of Hebrews describes Jesus to us he spends a great deal of time describing his ministry as our Great High Priest.
