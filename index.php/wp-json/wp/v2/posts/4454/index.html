As he cautiously scouts the camp he overhears a conversation between two soldiers. One is telling the other about a dream he&#8217;s had that has nearly scared him to death. In his dream he saw a tent that represented the Midian army. Then, of all things, he saw a giant loaf of barley bread, representing Gideon and the Israelites, tumbling down the hill into the camp and knocking down the tent of Midian. The soldier has concluded that this is a message from his gods that Gideon\u2019s army is going to roll over Midian. Overhearing all this is greatly encouraging to Gideon who concludes that God is preparing the way for his tiny force to defeat this mighty army. That night, when Gideon\u2019s 300 sound the trumpets, light their torches, and break the jars what the skittish Midian army hears and sees causes mass confusion and they begin fighting one another and running for their lives. In no time at all the battle that never was is over. I think stories like this are important to God\u2019s people. We need to tell them to our children and in telling them, instill in our boys and girls a deep faith in a God who takes care of his people in sometimes delightful, unusual ways. As we tell and retell stories like this, we, ourselves, are reminded of God\u2019s power over those things that overwhelm us and his faithfulness to us in all the circumstances of life. Maybe that\u2019s a message you need today.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord delights in doing good things for his people and he especially seems to enjoy doing those good things in unexpected ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The battle that never was Judges 7: I had this dream: A loaf of barley bread tumbled into the Midianite camp.
