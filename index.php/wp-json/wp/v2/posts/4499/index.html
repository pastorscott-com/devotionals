Although there are a few positive pictures: Ruth and Boaz and now Hannah, in general, the nature of spiritual life is in terrible condition. There\u2019s a central place of worship, Shiloh, but the way in which things are done there is more discouraging than encouraging. Eli is the priest, assisted by his two sons. Eli is permissive and disconnected. His sons are dishonest and immoral. The fact that the people of Israel have a place of worship and that people are coming to worship there is somewhat positive. The fact that worship is led by the likes of these men tells us that things are still in a pitiful condition. But that\u2019s about to change. The change isn\u2019t coming because key people are deciding to seek and find God. It isn&#8217;t coming because someone is pushing the right religious buttons to bring fresh life to a dead worship experience. The reason that the spiritual sun is about to rise is because God is about to move and, in fact, is already moving. God is always the First Mover. He doesn&#8217;t respond to what we do. Rather, we respond to what he does. Revival will come to Israel because God&#8217;s going to bring it, and then, Samuel and others will respond in obedience.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s a wonderful thing when the Lord begins to move in new ways in a life, church, or nation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God moves first 1 Samuel 3: This was at a time when the revelation of God was rarely heard or seen.
