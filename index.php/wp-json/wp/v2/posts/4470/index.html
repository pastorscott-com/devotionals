The Spirit of God came on him powerfully and he ripped it open barehanded.<br \/>\nSamson is the &#8220;strong man&#8221; of the Bible. When artists depict him, they always draw him as a muscle man. Frankly, I doubt it. Remember that his enemies try to discover the secret of his strength. If he\u2019s built like a super hero they wouldn&#8217;t do that. I think he\u2019s of average build and that the only physical characteristic that makes him stand out in a crowd is hair; hair, and lots of it: long, flowing hair on his head and on his face. This guy has never had a razor used on him. His nickname could be &#8220;Harry!&#8221; The key to his strength is tied into his faithfulness to God. And, in his case, the symbol of that faithfulness is uncut hair. Really, I don&#8217;t even see evidence that Samson is always strong. It\u2019s when the &#8220;Spirit of God comes on him&#8221; that he\u2019s strong. The rest of the time, he\u2019s just an ordinary, hairy guy. Thinking devotionally here, I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s when the Spirit of God moves in my life that I move into the realm of extraordinary possibilities. I may not be \u201cmore powerful than a locomotive\u201d but, when the Spirit of God is directing and empowering, I can do whatever it is the Lord wants me to do.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord gives us whatever capability he needs for us to have to accomplish his purposes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bible\u2019s strong man Judges 14: A young lion came at him, roaring.
