The nation of Israel is about to go through a culling.  Many will face the wrath of God but others will be preserved by his grace.  Frankly, from the devotional side of things I&#8217;m not sure what to do with passages like this.  Am I to be somewhat frightened and spend a few moments doing a personal spiritual inventory?  Am I to take on Isaiah&#8217;s role and start warning those &#8220;sinners&#8221; that the clock on God&#8217;s mercy is running out?  I guess the answer is somewhere in the middle.  I never arrive at the place where I\u2019m above consideration of my own spiritual condition.   Just a quick of reading the gospels reminds me that it\u2019s spiritual pride that\u2019s the downfall of the religious people of Jesus\u2019 day. On the other hand, if I\u2019m going to be effective in both warning and inviting the \u201coutsiders\u201d to come to the Lord I must do so in a sense of humility. Otherwise, I\u2019ll drive them away from both myself and their Savior.<br \/>\nTake Away: Always deal with lost people with a strong sense of personal humility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Speaking the truth in humility Isaiah 65: There are still plenty of good apples left.
