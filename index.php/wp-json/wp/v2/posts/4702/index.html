He collects women in the same way he collected wealth and fame. This will lead to his downfall. The Bible is always up front with us when it comes to the failures of its heroes, and that\u2019s the case here. Even as I read of Solomon\u2019s making silver as common as rocks in Israel, I read that he sins against God by marrying women from the surrounding pagan nations and allowing them to influence him away from God. His willingness to be &#8220;unequally yoked&#8221; brings about his great failure. No doubt infatuation with the opposite sex has been the downfall of many throughout history but the larger issue here is that God requires my first allegiance. Anything that comes between God and me becomes my god. To obsess over anything is to deny his Lordship in my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: We\u2019re never too smart or successful or, yes, even too wise to mess up. The key is to live close to the Lord and follow his directions for living.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Woman trouble 1Kings 11: King Solomon was obsessed with women.
