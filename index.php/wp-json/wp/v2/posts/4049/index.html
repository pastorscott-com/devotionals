Immediately, grace begins to flow, an unending river of good will toward these broken creatures. Sadly, the response is to reject the grace and push the Grace-Giver away. The crowning achievement of all God made has degenerated into a self-absorbed, God-ignoring shadow of what might have been. This \u201cfree-will\u201d business isn\u2019t working out and like radical surgery is sometimes needed to battle cancer, the Lord makes the painful decision to prune away all the foulness so that humanity will get another chance. For centuries the number of people who chose to respond to God\u2019s grace has dwindled. Now, one righteousness man is left. If humanity is to be saved, it&#8217;ll be through him. The focus of the universe is on righteous Noah. We won\u2019t see everything depending on just one man again until the Lord unleashes the eternal solution to the fallen condition of humanity. That will involve a willingness, not to build an ark, but to go to a cross.<br \/>\nTake away: The story of Noah is more about humanity getting a second chance than it is about judgment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One man Genesis 6: God was sorry that he had made the human race in the first place; it broke his heart.
