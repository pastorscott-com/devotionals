And this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!<br \/>\nElisha\u2019s servant, Gehazi, is chatting with the king about Elisha. When the king asks to hear some of the stories of this spiritual giant\u2019s life Gehazi begins recounting some of the high points of Elisha\u2019s ministry. One of the stories he tells is that of a woman whose son died. When Elisha arrived, he prayed and the son came back to life. Even as the king considers such an amazing thing a woman and her son are brought in for an audience with the king. Her concern is property rights and such matters are a big deal for these descendants of Abraham. Gehazi can hardly believe his eyes. It\u2019s the very woman and son that he\u2019s just been talking about! Because of that, the king is quick to give the woman justice and maybe even a bit more. Is it happenstance that the servant of Elisha just happens to be visiting the king that day? Is it mere chance that when the king asked for some \u201cElisha stories\u201d that Gehazi decides to talk about the resurrection of a certain woman\u2019s son? Is it just coincidence that she shows up just as Gehazi finishes his story? I don\u2019t think so. This has \u201cGod at work\u201d written all over it. I don\u2019t live out on the mystic edge of life about stuff like this. I do think that simple coincidences do happen. However, as I\u2019ve heard somewhere, I\u2019ve noticed that when I pray coincidences seem to happen more often. As I read this story today it\u2019s nice to be reminded of that.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord has a way of creating happy coincidences for his people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are the chances? 2Kings 8: This is the woman!
