When someone came into the room to go through a pre-surgery checklist, I excused myself and was about to leave.  However, my friend asked me to stay.  I reluctantly did so (by the way, I still don&#8217;t recommend that the pastor be present for such an interview).  As they went through the checklist I was amazed at how blunt it was.  Every possible problem was explained.  There was a 3% chance of this and a 5% chance of that.  Really, it was enough to scare a person!  As I reflected on that experience I made a decision to deal with spiritual realities with people in the hospital with the same frankness.  Rather than only focusing on praying for them that everything will be okay, I decided that, when the situation was right, I&#8217;d find a way to ask them how it is between them and God and offer to help them pray.  I&#8217;m not pretending that I always get that done.  For one thing, so many surgeries are now outpatient surgeries and the opportunity for such a conversation isn&#8217;t there.  Still, I&#8217;m reminded that we Christians aren&#8217;t to always tell people &#8220;everything&#8217;s going to be just fine&#8221; when there&#8217;s a real chance that it isn&#8217;t going to be fine.  I don&#8217;t have to scare people to death to offer to pray with them about spiritual needs in their life.  In fact, it may be the most comforting encounter of all.<br \/>\nTake Away: When the time is right Christians should be ready to have spiritual conversations with people they care about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A pastoral visit to the hospital Ezekiel 13: They&#8217;ve said, &#8220;No problem, everything&#8217;s just fine,&#8221; when things are not at all fine.
