As many cheer, giving Jesus a royal welcome into Jerusalem others harden in their opposition to him.  In less than a week Jesus will be dead.  Our Lord weeps, not for himself but for Jerusalem.  This city is at a crossroads in time.  This day could have been much more than the Triumphal Entry.  It could have ushered in a new, transformed age of peace on Earth, good will to men.  This week could have been a week without a cross.  Instead, the results of these days for Jerusalem will be horror, pain, suffering, and destruction.  It\u2019s a moment in time.  Listen, I don\u2019t claim to grasp the theology of all this but Jesus says it didn\u2019t have to be the way it was.  He wept as he considered how different things might have been.  As I deal with this passage from a devotional perspective I wonder how often people come to such pivotal moments.  I wonder how aware they are that they\u2019re about to walk into a trip wire that will change their lives forever.  My consolation is that in the case of the passage before us Jerusalem has had hundreds of years of opportunities to prepare for this moment.  It\u2019s not in ignorance that they\u2019re about to step off this cliff.  I have to believe that in smaller, personal ways that it\u2019s the same for us as we arrive at our crossroads in time.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: I may not always recognize the significance of life events so I must rely on the help of the Holy Spirit as I negotiate life.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crossroads in time Luke 19: All this because you didn\u2019t recognize and welcome God\u2019s personal visit.
