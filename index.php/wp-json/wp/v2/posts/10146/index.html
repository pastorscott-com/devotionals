Not only that but they\u2019re in the first generation of Christianity. In this passage Peter describes the general disposition of a believer. Christians are to be agreeable, sympathetic people. We\u2019re to be known for our compassion on others and our humility concerning ourselves. We\u2019re not to advance the cause of Christianity by force and people aren\u2019t to have to worry about watching their \u201cP\u2019s &amp; Q\u2019s\u201d when they\u2019re around us. Even non-Christians are to feel comfortable and it should go without saying that we\u2019re to treat one another in kind, agreeable ways. Sad to say, some believers haven\u2019t gotten this memo. They think that they\u2019re doing God a favor by forcing their moral code down people\u2019s throats. They think they\u2019re being good soldiers in his army by creating lots of collateral damage on fellow believers with whom they have a few differences of opinion. The question I need to ask myself is how do I score on this \u201cagreeable, sympathetic, loving, compassionate, humble\u201d test? Peter, it seems, can almost hear people\u2019s self-justification at this point, so he adds: \u201cThat goes for all of you, no exceptions.\u201d He continues, \u201cThat\u2019s your job, to bless.\u201d Of course, my non-Christian friends are to know that I believe there\u2019s a superior way for them to live. At the same time, they\u2019re to conclude an encounter with me feeling that they\u2019ve been blessed and not cursed.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Do people think of time with us as a blessing or a curse?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The disposition of the believer 1Peter 3: Be agreeable, be sympathetic, be loving, be compassionate, be humble.
