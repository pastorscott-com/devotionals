One thing he does that\u2019s interesting is that he puts together a team to go out and conduct what might be called revival meetings across his country. These men teach the people how they\u2019re to live as a people of God. The king\u2019s approach is successful both at home and, so some extent in the nations surrounding tiny Judah. The peoples of those nations develop a healthy respect for \u201cGod\u2019s people\u201d in Judah. Not only are they hesitant to make trouble with these neighbors, but they want to be on the good side of them and their God. Amazingly, the Philistines, their enemies across the centuries, come with gifts for Jehoshaphat. His reign looks like a smaller version of that of his ancestor Solomon. I think it\u2019s neat to be able to sit here in the comfort of my favorite chair literally thousands of years after these events and see how Jehoshapaht\u2019s decision to seek, follow, and obey the Lord impacts his life as the years pass. Even as ripples spread from a stone tossed into a pond so do blessings spread through a life when a person decides to seek, follow, and obey the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: The impact of a decision for the Lord reaches farther than we ever imagine.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the long run 2 Chronicles 17: He was a seeker and follower of the God of his father and was obedient to him.
