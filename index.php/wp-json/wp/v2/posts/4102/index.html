Jacob, that \u201cheel grasper\u201d who cheated his rather dim witted brother and lied to his nearly blind father, has met his match in his uncle Laban. After working for seven years for the hand of the beautiful Rachel he ends up with her sister Leah instead. He doesn\u2019t even realize what\u2019s happening until, if you catch my drift, \u201cafter the fact.\u201d Again, poor Leah is caught in the middle and I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for her. Still, there\u2019s a feeling that Jacob\u2019s getting what\u2019s coming to him. Finally, the cheater experiences what it\u2019s like to be cheated. He ends up with both sisters as wives, and when their maids are added in, he has a small harem. Anyone who reads about the rivalry and competition that develops out of this arraignment can never come to the conclusion that polygamy is a good idea. Their lives are a real mess. However, even as this silliness plays out I see God\u2019s hand at work. The Lord takes the cheating and scheming and ill-advised multiple marriages situation and turns it on its head, working through human failings to keep the promise he made to Abraham. Even as I read this story and shake my head at its folly, I see God\u2019s grace at work.<br \/>\nTake away: God can work through even silly things to accomplish his will.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jacob reaps what he has sown Genesis 29: Why did you cheat me?
