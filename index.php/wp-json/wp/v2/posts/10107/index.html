The church at Thessalonica has been in existence for less than 10. When Paul first came to them with the gospel message there was a sense of urgency about it. Each day might be \u201cthe day.\u201d If friends and loved ones were to be saved it had to happen soon, before the glorious return of Jesus. Now, years have passed and, while their belief in the Second Coming remains strong, a new concern has surfaced. There\u2019s been a death in the church. One of their own has become sick and died. Now that the funeral is over there\u2019s a quiet but serious debate about their fate. The decision is made to contact the man who first told them about Jesus and who taught them about the Second Coming. Paul\u2019s answer is concise and certain. The dead in Christ will be just fine. In fact, they\u2019ll rise to meet Jesus first, before the living believers get their turn. Even as Jesus rose from the grave so will they. Jesus has defeated death and it has no hold on his people. For believers, the final word isn\u2019t the ritual said at the graveside. Today, I stake my eternity on this passage and others like it. This promise flavors my view of life and death and life after death. Sooner or later every person must have that \u201cquiet and serious\u201d conversation, at least with themselves, concerning what they really believe about this, \u201clife and death\u201d topic.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christians are a people of hope and that hope is no more evident than in our attitude toward death.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Life and death and life 1Thessalonians 4: God will most certainly bring back to life those who died in Jesus.
