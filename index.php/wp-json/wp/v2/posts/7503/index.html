He sees them walking through a devastated Jerusalem and confessing it was their sins that brought it all to pass.  In the face of such repentance, Ezekiel has an encouraging word: God specializes in taking messed up things and restoring them to &#8220;better than new&#8221; condition.  Once the Lord&#8217;s given a chance, he&#8217;ll turn these weed patches into a &#8220;Garden of Eden.&#8221;  No doubt, these are encouraging words to the people of Ezekiel&#8217;s day.  They&#8217;re uplifting words for us too.  In a more literal sense, we look forward to a &#8220;new heaven and a new earth&#8221; that has been promised by God.  What sin has destroyed the Lord will redeem &#8212; and that redeemed world will be vastly superior to what we see now.  In a spiritual sense, this passage describes what the Lord accomplishes in the human heart.  Sin destroys lives, making a wreck out of what was once wonderfully promising.  When I cooperate with God, opening my life up to him he goes to work.  In my life he &#8220;rebuilds ruins and replants empty waste places.&#8221;  He&#8217;s God, and he does stuff like that.  As Ezekiel puts it, &#8220;I, God, said so, and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord specializes in taking messed up things and restoring them to &#8220;better than new&#8221; condition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The kind of stuff God does Ezekiel 36: I, God, rebuild ruins and replant empty waste places.
