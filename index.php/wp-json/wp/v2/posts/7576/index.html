She&#8217;s left the man and children who love her.  Her story will end with her in bondage physically, emotionally, and legally if not for Hosea.  Under the Lord&#8217;s direction, he moves to rescue her from the stupid mess that binds her.  Hosea acts under God&#8217;s command but he also acts out of love.  In spite of Gomer&#8217;s rejection of him he can&#8217;t move past his love for her.  She&#8217;s brought disgrace to Hosea, possibly making him a laughingstock in the community.  She&#8217;s broken his heart and turned away from his love without even a word of apology.  Still, Hosea can&#8217;t let go.  This is no simple picture of romantic love.  Here I see love that demands sacrifice.  I see a stubborn love that persists even when the object of that love is unworthy.  God says he loves his people like this.  On one hand, he can&#8217;t ignore their sin and rebellion.  On the other, he can&#8217;t just walk away.  Because God is who he is, he loves.  This is the hope of every human being.  I&#8217;m fallen, unlovely, and condemned.  My only hope is God&#8217;s love: his sacrificing, stubborn love.  &#8220;While we were yet sinners Christ died for us.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Because the Lord is who he is, he loves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sacrificing, stubborn love Hosea 3: Love her the way I, God, love the Israelite people.
