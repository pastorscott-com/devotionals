In fact, his great High Priestly prayer is about to begin.  Still, he encourages his disciples to \u201cmake your requests directly to him\u201d promising that the Father is ready and willing to hear and answer their prayers.  The reason for this is because of their relationship with Jesus.  Three years earlier they met Jesus.  Some were out in the wilderness where John was baptizing; others were in Galilee as they went about their daily activities.  They\u2019ve now followed him for three years and during that time they\u2019ve come to believe Jesus is the Son of God.  In these final hours before everything changes, Jesus tells his disciples that the Father is quite pleased with them for believing in his Son.  They\u2019ve left all to follow him and they\u2019ve loved Jesus and trusted in him and, because of that, their relationship with the Heavenly Father has changed in a wonderful way.  From now on, when they pray to the Father, they\u2019re authorized by the Father, himself, to pray in the Name of Jesus.  They\u2019ve loved Jesus, and now, the Father loves them all the more for it and they\u2019re about to reap the benefits of being people who please the Father.  I\u2019m nothing close to equal to Peter or James or John, but I have this in common with them: I too love, trust, and follow Jesus.  Because of that, in spite of my unworthiness and failure to really understand all that it means to me, I have the assurance that the Father \u201cloves me directly.\u201d  I\u2019m not sure exactly what that means, but I\u2019ve had just a taste of it and what I\u2019ve tasted is very good.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s a powerful thing to be a person with whom the Father is pleased.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Loved by God John 16: The Father loves you directly.
