He says that as a person who walked with Jesus, knowing him intimately, he wants to tell us how we too can experience an intimate relationship with the Lord. The key, he says, is our \u201cwalking in the light.\u201d Immediately he defines that for us. To walk in the light is to walk with God. Obviously, there\u2019s a way of living that nurtures a close, abiding relationship with the Lord. That way of life has wonderful benefits for me. For one thing as I walk in the light I find myself in the company of God\u2019s people. For another, it\u2019s in that relationship that the blood of Jesus is applied to my life, making me clean of all my sin. As I live in the light, I join the multitudes that have been made clean by the work of Christ. John is remembered as \u201cthe beloved\u201d and as I walk with the Lord I join countless others who can be rightly called \u201cbeloved.\u201d What a wonderful prospect!<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: It\u2019s such an amazing blessing to be one of the \u201cbeloved.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Walking in the light 1John 1: If we walk in the light\u2026 John the Apostle is a man who enjoyed a close relationship with Jesus.
