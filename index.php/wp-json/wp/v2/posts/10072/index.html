Apparently, one of the members of the congregation at Corinth was living in an immoral relationship with his stepmother. Now, Paul has received word that the church took action on this. There has been, first: discipline, and then, second: repentance, and now, forgiveness. Paul tells them that that\u2019s good enough for him. He stands by their handling of things and now counsels them to add a double portion of love for the one who had been involved in the immorality. Otherwise, he cautions, the enemy of their souls will use the situation to work against them, doing more harm than good. It seems to me that the church generally errs on the extremes of issues like this. Sometimes, we\u2019re so open minded that we just go with the flow. People behave in immoral ways and \u201cwe just love them anyway\u201d never getting around to pointing out that their behavior will destroy their lives and damn their souls. In other situations, the church is so intent on \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d that we drive away the very people for whom Christ died. We think we\u2019re being spiritual, but really we\u2019re just being hateful. In the middle there\u2019s loving people enough to tell them the truth in such a way that they know we love them. God is a God of Second Chances and the church should be a Church of Second Chances.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: We need the help of the Lord to find the middle ground when dealing with sinners who are loved by Christ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God is the God of Second Chances 2Corinthians 2: Getting you to take responsibility for the health of the church.
