Sometimes, as I\u2019m reminded here, I\u2019m better off to pray without words at all and let God be in charge of what happens next. It does make sense. God is always the &#8220;first mover.&#8221; After all, the Bible doesn&#8217;t start off with &#8220;In the beginning man&#8230;&#8221;! So, rather than coming to prayer in what might be called &#8220;automatic mode,&#8221; in which every prayer is pretty much a copy of the one before, or with a sense of formality, I want to come to him humbly and honestly; not saying what I think he wants to hear, but in a genuine desire to hear from him. If I let him lead the way my prayer time will be more satisfying to both the Lord and to me. Prayer is just as much a matter of listening as it is a matter of talking.<br \/>\nTake Away: Being still before the Lord is a legitimate approach to prayer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Listening in prayer Ecclesiastes 5: Don&#8217;t be too quick to tell God what you think he wants to hear.
