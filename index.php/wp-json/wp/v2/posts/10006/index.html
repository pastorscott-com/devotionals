The first section concerns our Lord\u2019s relationship with his Father.  All that has happened and will happen is done for the purpose of displaying the glory of God, a glory shared by Father and Son; a glory that has existed since before the world began.  Second, Jesus prays for his disciples.  He\u2019s going to depart, but they\u2019re going to stay.  His purpose of bringing glory to the Father will now be their purpose.  Jesus prays that everything about his disciples will accomplish that purpose and that they\u2019ll be protected from all that might distract from their mission.  Third, Jesus prays for future believers.  Again, there\u2019s a prayer for unity of heart and purpose.  Our Lord prays that the believers will give evidence that Jesus is the one sent from God because of his love for us.  Jesus concludes his prayer by asking the Father to gather all believers to himself, where they can bask in the glory of the Lord, united in love for God and for one another.  This passage, my friend, is holy ground.  We\u2019re allowed to listen in to a conversation within the Godhead.  We witness the Son\u2019s communion with the Father and then, we\u2019re invited into the conversation.  It\u2019s humbling to be allowed in this place today.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: God\u2019s people are considered \u201cinsiders.\u201d  What an honor!<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Listening to Jesus pray John 17: Father, it\u2019s time.
