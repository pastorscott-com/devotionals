These boys don\u2019t look anything alike and their personalities are clearly different one from one another. It\u2019s no surprise that their mother Rebekah knows something\u2019s wrong. And no wonder: her body is a sort of war zone! Her babies don\u2019t get along and they\u2019re yet to see the light of day! Their story is, to say the least, a thought provoking one. Here are two babies being born to the same parents, sharing a womb, and sibling rivalry is already full blown. We\u2019ve all said, at one time or another, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d Most often that\u2019s an excuse for failing to practice self-discipline in some area. However, I\u2019m reminded in this passage that there\u2019s truth to that statement. We aren\u2019t born as blank slates ready to be shaped by the events of our lives. Some stuff about us is hard wired from the start. In this case, Jacob and his brother are hard wired for conflict. Their parents, who will play favorites with their sons, won\u2019t help matters any. So what, if anything, can be done about the undesirable tendencies with which we\u2019re born? To some extent, parents can teach their children self-discipline and thus help them learn to deal with their natural dispositions. I\u2019m glad, though, to report that there\u2019s a greater remedy. As we read this story we see God at work, especially in Jacob\u2019s life. As God\u2019s grace unfolds, we see a man who\u2019s changed as only God can change him.<br \/>\nTake away: God can do for us that which we could never do for ourselves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>That\u2019s just the way I am Genesis 25: The children tumbled and kicked inside her.
