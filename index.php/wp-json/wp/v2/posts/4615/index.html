David remembers being called in from the fields as he cared for his father&#8217;s sheep to meet the old man of God, Samuel. In a private ceremony Samuel anointed him king of Israel. However, Israel already had a king and Saul wasn&#8217;t about to give up his position of power, so David waited. He faithfully served Israel, doing anything asked of him. He honored Saul, even as Saul became his enemy. It isn&#8217;t that David\u2019s made no errors along the way; he has. The bottom line, though, is that he\u2019s faithfully adhered to this philosophy: if God had him anointed as king, then he\u2019ll be king in God&#8217;s own time. Now, the result of treachery in Ish-Bosheth&#8217;s camp, the door is finally open and all Israel comes to make David king. The deaths of both Saul and Ish-Bosheth were not by David&#8217;s hand. In fact, it isn&#8217;t the way he wanted it at all. Still, God works in all things, even things he doesn\u2019t design, to accomplish his purpose. David isn&#8217;t the only one who\u2019s been patient. God, Himself, has worked in and through and even around the events that have taken place to move history in the direction he desires. The end result is that, just as Samuel said years earlier: David is king of Israel. Here\u2019s a picture of how God works: not orchestrating and micromanaging events to get his way, but directing the outcome of even bad things, like murder, to accomplish his purposes. He doesn&#8217;t motivate the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite to kill Ish-Bosheth, but when they do, the Lord uses it to accomplish his purpose of bringing David to the throne of Israel.<br \/>\nTake Away: As Sovereign God the Lord works in this world, even though poor choices made by people, to accomplish his purposes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God, patiently working 2 Samuel 4: And so they anointed David king over Israel.
