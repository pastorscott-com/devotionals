We Westerners are individualists who like to think we make our own decisions apart from others.  In this case it was 40 years earlier that Moses had said these words and &#8220;they&#8221; refused to hear, refused to have faith, and refused to obey.  The penalty was 40 years in the wilderness &#8212; an experience all those in the congregation hearing this sermon did share, at least to some extent.  Soon it will be their turn to hear, believe, and obey.  Moses is preparing them for it by reminding them of their already shared failure in their parents.  Still, God is the God of Second Chances.  Soon they will stand on the banks of the river.  To a great extent they will have the opportunity to erase the failure of those who went before them.  While I\u2019m no expert on &#8220;generational curses&#8221; (or &#8220;generational blessings&#8221; for that matter) I\u2019m reminded that my failure or faithfulness reaches far beyond my individual life.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s unlikely anyone ever sees the full extent of their influence, be it for good or for evil.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The distant reach of failure Deuteronomy 1: Don&#8217;t be terrified of them, God, your God, is leading the way; he&#8217;s fighting for you.
