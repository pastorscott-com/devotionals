The idea came from the churches in Macedonia but has now spread throughout the Gentile Church.  There\u2019s no pressure as to what individuals give.  Paul just urges people to give the best they are able.  He does note though, that in spite of the Macedonian Christians going through some hard times of their own that they\u2019ve set the giving bar pretty high.  Now, Paul\u2019s sending some folks to Corinth to collect their offering and take it to Jerusalem.  He\u2019s quite business like in his approach and wants to assure them that Titus won\u2019t be alone in caring for this money but will be joined by another trustworthy individual in handling it.  The Apostle adds that he doesn\u2019t want anyone to have any reason to think he\u2019s skimming expense money off the top of this designated offering.  He wants them to be confident that everything they give will go to its designated purpose.  As a pastor I\u2019ve always followed Paul\u2019s approach in money matters.  I try to stay away from handling church cash if at all possible.  Also, in the church we deal with money handling issues using accepted business practices along with a dose of sanctified common sense.  Like Paul, we want to handle money and other church assets in such a way that no reasonable person will have reason to question our honesty.  Beyond that, of course, we\u2019re well aware that the Almighty sees it all and that someday we\u2019ll stand before him in Judgment. <\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Good business practices are good business for the church.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good business 2Corinthians 8: We don\u2019t want anyone suspecting us of taking one penny of this money for ourselves.
