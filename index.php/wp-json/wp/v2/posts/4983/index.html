We&#8217;re his servants and we&#8217;re going to work, rebuilding.<br \/>\nUpon his arrival in Jerusalem, Nehemiah quietly inspects the walls of the city. Well, it might be better said that he inspects the ruins of the city walls. They were demolished decades earlier. He meets with city leaders and proposes that the next big project be rebuilding those walls and gains their enthusiastic support. As word of this project spreads, we meet Nehemiah&#8217;s three adversaries: Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem. These men are leaders of the area&#8217;s non-Jewish residents and they oppose the rebuilding of Jerusalem&#8217;s walls. There&#8217;s likely a power struggle here. At first, the returning Jews brought welcome capital and man power to the area, but now they threaten to become its dominant residents once again. Nehemiah&#8217;s reply to them is that in spite of the overwhelming task before them and even in spite of the opposition of these three men that he\u2019s assured of success. The reason is that he is doing God&#8217;s work and that God, Himself, will bring them success. As I hear this declaration of faith from a man standing in the rubble of a city I\u2019m impressed with his absolute trust in God. This isn&#8217;t some &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; situation; this is real work in the most unlikely of circumstances and with real and powerful opposition. Nehemiah doesn&#8217;t think he can rebuild the wall because he\u2019s going to try real hard or because he\u2019s going to outsmart his enemies. He\u2019s going to do it because God\u2019s there to help them. There\u2019s a good lesson here for me in all I attempt to do in the name of the Lord.<br \/>\nTake Away: If it\u2019s up to me the chances of success are nominal. If I\u2019m doing God\u2019s work God\u2019s way, the chances of success are 100 percent.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With God\u2019s help anything is possible Nehemiah 2: The God-of-Heaven will make sure we succeed.
