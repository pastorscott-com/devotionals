His bright glory fills the whole earth.<br \/>\nIsaiah is already a prophet of God when he has his vision of the holiness of God.  However, it\u2019s that vision that fuels his ministry and transforms his relationship with God.  He sees worship taking place in heaven, with heavenly beings shouting out the holiness of God.  Everything\u2019s impacted by that holiness: foundations trembling, billowing smoke&#8230;and a humbled prophet of God.  So what does it mean for God to be &#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy&#8221;?  While I think the triple statement of God&#8217;s being holy is intended to cause us to think of his holiness as being complete and not meant to give pastors the makings of three point sermons I do see three aspects of the holiness of God.  First, his holiness is that of purity.  God is untouched by sin and sin is absolutely foreign to his character.  Second, his holiness is that of separateness.   God isn\u2019t humanity multiplied.  There\u2019s an &#8220;otherness&#8221; about him and while we\u2019re created in his image, there is that about God which is forever beyond our understanding.  Third, his holiness is that of transcendence.  Even as the brightness of the sun both warms the earth, giving life, and at the same time is so powerful as to be frightening to us, so is God&#8217;s holiness both beautiful and at the same time awesome and untouchable by us.  Had God not revealed his holiness to us we\u2019d have zero chance of even dimly contemplating it.  Isaiah doesn&#8217;t write an essay about his thoughts on God&#8217;s holiness.  Rather, he has a God-given vision of it, and once he has that vision he\u2019s never the same.<br \/>\nTake Away: A God who is holy, holy, holy should be worshiped and feared.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Holiness Isaiah 6: Holy, Holy, Holy is the God-of-the-Angel-Armies.
