Now, even though Joseph has forgiven them we see that they haven\u2019t yet forgiven themselves. The reason for this is that, if their roles were reversed, they\u2019d still be holding a grudge. When their father dies they\u2019re afraid that it was for the sake of Jacob that Joseph never took revenge on them. When Joseph realizes what\u2019s happening he assures his brothers that he has no intention of striking out at them. Through the years Joseph has had lots of time to think about the flow of events in his life and he\u2019s developed an insightful theology about it all. On one hand, he knows that it wasn\u2019t God who planned evil things against him. Clearly, it was his brothers who did this and Joseph makes no attempt to say the Lord was behind their evil deed. On the other hand, Joseph sees that when his brothers did their worst that they couldn\u2019t derail God\u2019s ultimate plan. God moved in and redeemed their evil act, turning it into good for Joseph and even for those evil-deed-doing bothers. Earlier, Joseph told his brothers, concerning his being sold into slavery, that \u201cGod did it.\u201d Now we see that, while this statement isn\u2019t wrong, it&#8217;s incomplete. When people act in their own free will to do the wrong thing God has a knack of stepping in and transforming it into something good. My friend, considering that this conversation takes place over a century before the Ten Commandments are given that\u2019s a pretty mature theology.<br \/>\nTake away: God doesn\u2019t do bad things to accomplish his will, but he\u2019s capable of working through bad things to bring his purposes to pass.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More on \u201cGod did it\u201d Genesis 50: Don\u2019t you see, you planned evil against me but God used those same plans for my good\u2026.
