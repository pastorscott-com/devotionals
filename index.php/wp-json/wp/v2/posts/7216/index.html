Even the mighty Nile, the symbol of life in Egypt, will be dried up and the nation will be in a hopeless state.  Surprisingly, Isaiah&#8217;s tone suddenly changes.  It\u2019s almost as though the storm ends and the sun breaks through.  God will make an appearance to Egypt and, with all else swept away, the people of that land will turn to him with all their hearts.  Isaiah says, &#8220;Egypt will come back to God.&#8221;  Additionally, we\u2019re told, Assyria will join Egypt in the worship of God and the result will be that they\u2019ll &#8220;share the blessing.&#8221;  In one of his most famous statements Jesus announces that God &#8220;so loved the world.&#8221;  However, here we are back in the Old Testament where a Hebrew prophet has been, just as would be expected, telling how God\u2019s going to destroy all the enemies of the people of Israel.  Then, the tone of his prophecy suddenly changes.  The enemies of God&#8217;s people aren&#8217;t going to be wiped off the face of the earth.  Instead, they\u2019re going to be converted!  Here, then is the heart of every missionary effort.  If God wants to do away with those who reject him, he can do it with just a word.  Instead, he engineers circumstances designed to draw us to him.  Granted, some of those circumstances are stout medicine, but, then again, it isn&#8217;t annihilation, which is what we deserve.  In this somewhat confusing turnabout passage we get a glimpse of what will only become clear through the ministry of Jesus.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord wants to save all people \u2013 that\u2019s good news for you and me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Missionary outreach Isaiah 19: God will openly show himself to the Egyptians and they&#8217;ll get to know him on that Day.
