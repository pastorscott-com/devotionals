These boys become men and these men are worshipers of God. One is a dirt farmer and the other raises livestock. These two worshipers of God bring sacrifices to the Lord. To Cain\u2019s dismay God likes his brother\u2019s offering better than his own. I\u2019ve heard a few sermons on the reason why. In fact, I\u2019ve attempted to deal with the topic myself. Some people think it\u2019s the lack of blood in Cain\u2019s offering. Others pounce on the \u201cfirstborn\u201d aspect of Abel\u2019s offering and the writer of the book of Hebrews focuses in on the faith aspect of it. Deciding why one offering is more acceptable than the other is a hard call. After all, Cain brought from what he had, just as Abel did. Of course, we know that this passage isn\u2019t here to elevate one type of offering over the other. This account is about sin, murder, and grace. When Cain&#8217;s angry with God about his brother\u2019s offering the Lord warns him that he\u2019s skating on thin ice. Being disappointed with God, apparently, isn\u2019t sin in itself; but such an attitude attracts sin. The Lord speaks to Cain like a father talking to his son, warning him that it\u2019s a dangerous road he\u2019s traveling. This situation has potential for Cain to be humbled. If he responds to the Lord by asking for an explanation concerning why his offering is inferior to Abel\u2019s we won\u2019t have the mystery concerning it. Instead, Cain proves God right by doing the wrong thing. At this point, the score is Sin: one, Cain: nothing.<br \/>\nTake away: Some things that aren\u2019t quite sin, can, if I\u2019m not careful, open that door.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sin, murder, and grace Genesis 4: Sin is lying in wait for you&#8230;you\u2019ve got to master it.
