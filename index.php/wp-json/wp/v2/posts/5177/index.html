David says that God separates me from my sins and the psalmist picks the widest distance he can think of to describe just how far those sins are removed from me.  The testimony of a young woman comes to mind.  Although she was raised by a godly mother she messed up in several ways.  After some years as a prodigal daughter she came back to the Lord but was living a very different life than she might have lived without that disastrous detour.  In a church service I began to deal with the concept I find in this passage: how God casts our sins away as far as east is from west.  For everyone else in that service it was just another Sunday sermon, but the Holy Spirit spoke to her heart that day making that truth her personal truth that day.  Since her return to Christ she had carried the burden of her past, often aware of her failures.  However, on that day she realized that she had not only been forgiven by the Lord, but that he had also set her free from the guilt she was carrying.  From that day forward she had a new freedom and joy in the Lord.  Maybe this is the message you need today.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for forgiveness and, beyond that, for separating our sins from us, casting them out of our lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oh, God is so good!
