Nehemiah 9 is made up mostly of a song written to tell this story. In it, God&#8217;s grace and mercy is highlighted. The Lord is good to them, from Abram of Ur to the day when they occupied the Promised Land. However, there\u2019s great spiritual failure as their ancestors reject God and his Law. There\u2019s a lot of repentance in this song, but there\u2019s also great hope. God is still their God and they rely on him to deliver them from their enemies and re-establish them in this place that was promised to Abraham so long ago. This song is not only a song of history but is a hymn of invitation as well. As it ends, the heads of the families are challenged to come forward to sign a binding pledge. From this moment forward they&#8217;ll be a faithful people of God. They\u2019re sure of God&#8217;s grace, now they commit themselves to that grace. It&#8217;s a powerful moment. Without it, the story of Nehemiah is just about rebuilding a wall. With it, we have a story about God rebuilding a people.<br \/>\nTake Away: Thank the Lord for his patient, merciful, transforming grace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rebuilding project Nehemiah 9: In your great compassion you heard and helped them again.
