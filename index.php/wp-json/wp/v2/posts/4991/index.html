Prayer is backed up by planning. He stations armed guards, divides the work crew up into builders and defenders, and distributes weapons to every worker. He also assigns trumpeters to each work crew so that they can quickly call for help if an attack comes. Some are given double duty: they&#8217;re guards at night and workmen by day. They sleep in their clothes with weapons at hand. A key phrase is: &#8220;and so we kept working.&#8221; Nehemiah and his crew&#8217;s commitment to the task is impressive. Even without the threat of an attack their job is a daunting one as they attempt to build a great wall out of rubble. Great accomplishments often include working through opposition and discouragement. It might be said that the greater the goal the more difficult the task. How do I respond in such situations? Do I work with &#8220;a tool in one hand and a spear in the other&#8221; or do I decide it\u2019s too hard and find an easier route? Nehemiah&#8217;s story teaches us the importance of preparedness and perseverance.<br \/>\nTake Away: Preparedness, perseverance, and prayerfulness: these three are keys to accomplishing great things in the Name of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Preparedness and perseverance Nehemiah 4: The common laborers held a tool in one hand and a spear in the other.
