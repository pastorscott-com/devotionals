Daniel has lived in a pagan culture for a long time but he&#8217;s found an anchor in prayer.  Three times each day he retreats to a place of prayer, keeping his connection with his God intact.  Through the years he&#8217;s risen to a powerful position in multiple administrations.  He&#8217;s been an explainer of dreams and a solver of mysteries.  Now we see the key to it all.  Daniel prays.  I don&#8217;t think I can overestimate the importance of my &#8220;continuing to pray.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: Nothing takes the place of prayer in the lives of the people of the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keep up the good work Daniel 6: He continued to pray just as he had always done.
