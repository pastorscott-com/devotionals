Jeremiah doesn&#8217;t give us the details, just that it happened as the Lord had said it would.  Jeremiah is put in chains and included in the mass relocation program that&#8217;s the policy of the conquering Babylonians.  However, when the commanding officer, Nebuzharadan surveys his captives, he takes note of Jeremiah.  This heathen military man knows the story.  He knows that Jeremiah has, for years, been warning his people that all this was coming.  Nebuzharadan declares Jeremiah free.  He can travel to Babylon as his guest or he can return to Jerusalem.  He even goes so far as to encourage Jeremiah to go to the vassal king, Gedaliah, who has been put into power over Judah.  I find it interesting that God&#8217;s man is shown more respect by a heathen captain than he was given by the now as good as dead Zedekiah, king of Judah and descendant of David.  Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t be greatly surprised at this because it&#8217;s a fairly common occurrence.  For instance, when the Savior is born, &#8220;wise men from the east&#8221; come to honor him.  They get directions from the experts in Jerusalem, but those same experts aren&#8217;t themselves interested in making the short jaunt to Bethlehem.  Here&#8217;s my take on this today: sometimes God&#8217;s people aren&#8217;t as much God&#8217;s people as they think they are and sometimes lost people aren&#8217;t as lost as we might think.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord works though some unlikely people, especially when the \u201clikely ones\u201d aren\u2019t up to the task.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kindness from an unexpected source Jeremiah 40: The captain of the bodyguard singled out Jeremiah.
