He returns to where his ministry began, out in the wilderness along River Jordan.  It was here that John the Baptizer introduced Jesus as the Messiah, the Savior of the world.  In ways similar to what happened in his earlier ministry in Galilee, people are drawn to Jesus and now they come in droves.  In this setting the crowds can\u2019t help but remember John\u2019s glowing predictions concerning Jesus, made right here just a few years earlier.  They conclude that John nailed it.  Jesus is everything John said he would be.  There\u2019s something powerful about telling people about Jesus.  Even as we make our pitifully inadequate effort to tell the story it\u2019s Spirit-powered.  Then, the moment our hearer looks toward Jesus something begins to happen in their lives.  As it was with John, our role instantly begins to shrink and the role of Jesus begins to expand in their lives.  Still, it\u2019s deeply gratifying, yet humbling at the same time, when someone takes a moment to glance back our way and comment, \u201cThat\u2019s the person who first told me about Jesus.\u201d  I want to do a better job of pointing the way to all who will listen.<\/p>\n<p>Take away: There\u2019s something powerful about telling people about Jesus.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>He measures up John 10: Everything he said about this man has come true.
