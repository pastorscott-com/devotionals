His father Uzziah\u2019s affliction keeps him from running the government and Jotham rules in his father\u2019s place. After seven years of this arrangement, upon the death of Uzziah, Jotham ascends to the throne. He gets high marks in both the 2nd Kings and 2nd Chronicles accounts of his reign. However, both accounts are rather brief. Jotham does some significant construction and has a couple of major military campaigns. The bottom line of his life is that his \u201cstrength was rooted in his steady and determined life of obedience to God.\u201d If a person\u2019s life is to be summed up in one sentence, that\u2019s a pretty good sentence to hear. Words like \u201cstrength,\u201d \u201csteady,\u201d determined,\u201d and \u201cobedience of God\u201d leave us wanting to hear more about this good man. One nice thing about the account of Jotham\u2019s life is that there\u2019s no \u201cbut&#8230;\u201d after the epitaph I\u2019m considering today. I wonder what words will be used to someday describe my life? Unlike Jotham I\u2019ll never be a famous person or a national leader. By the grace of God, though, \u201csteadiness, determination, and obedience of God\u201d is within my grasp. Even people who live \u201cone chapter lives\u201d can make that chapter count for something worthwhile.<br \/>\nTake Away: A life lived for the Lord is a life well lived.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One chapter lives 2 Chronicles 27: Jotham\u2019s strength was rooted in his steady and determined life of obedience to God.
