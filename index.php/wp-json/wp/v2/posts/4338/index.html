In this distant day each nation has its own gods and it\u2019s unthinkable for anyone to imagine a nation kicking out its gods to worship those of another nation.  I\u2019m pretty sure a case could be made that we still have &#8220;national gods.&#8221;  In the instance of my country those gods are named &#8220;Materialism&#8221; and &#8220;Pleasure.&#8221;  However, instead of pursuing that line of thought (come to think of it, I guess I already did!) I\u2019ll focus on what it\u2019s like to worship the true God.  Humans don\u2019t make this God out of some precious metal.  Rather, this God makes human beings out of the dust of the ground.  This God makes no demand of those who serve him that he doesn&#8217;t first make of himself.  For instance, before he calls people to love him he first loves them.  In fact, this God always acts first, moving in grace-full ways in the lives of people.  And, as Moses says, this God seeks intimacy with his Creation.  Moses wants his congregation to realize how blessed they are.  Of all the nations of the earth, they have the God who willingly involves himself at every level of their lives.  Today, this Almighty Being invites me to experience that same level of intimacy, that personal day-to-day relationship with him.<br \/>\nTake Away: What a privilege it is for the creature to have intimate fellowship with the Creator.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intimacy with God Deuteronomy 4: What other great nation has gods that are intimate with them the way God, our God, is with us?
