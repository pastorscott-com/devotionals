He\u2019s disturbed by all the shrines to all the deities worshiped there.  He\u2019s even seen one shrine dedicated to the \u201cunknown god.\u201d  The folks there don\u2019t want to overlook some god and unintentionally get on the bad side of him!  When Paul gets a chance to be heard, he uses that shrine as his launching point.  He\u2019s there to tell them about the God they\u2019ve missed.  His argument is right out of the Old Testament.  The prophets of old often called their people to worship the God not made with human hands.  Paul tells them that the God he serves is good and gracious, blessing their lives even though they haven\u2019t acknowledged him.  This God reaches out to them, inviting them to live in a relationship with him.  However, there comes a time when the \u201cunknown\u201d becomes the \u201cknown.\u201d  It\u2019s one thing to enjoy the blessings of God in ignorance.  It\u2019s something altogether different to know of this good God and to intentionally ignore him.  In fact, God intends to divide people along that very line.  He\u2019s so serious about it that he\u2019s already appointed a Judge over the people of the earth.  To make it perfectly clear to the whole world that this is his chosen Judge, God has raised him from the dead.  Many of Paul\u2019s listeners, worshipers of a variety of gods, can\u2019t swallow this \u201cresurrection business.\u201d  They can\u2019t imagine their gods having that kind of power.  They walk away believing that they\u2019ve just heard an impossible myth.  Others, though, are drawn to this good God and his resurrected, appointed Judge.  They want to know more.  I know where I stand on this issue.  Where do you stand?<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: This \u201cUnknown God\u201d can, and wants to be known by all.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Unknown God Acts 17: He makes the creatures; the creatures don\u2019t make him.
