The picture of the potter sculpting the clay and then remaking it is as clear a parable as we\u2019ll ever see.  It\u2019s not that the potter doesn&#8217;t know what he\u2019s doing or that he becomes distracted and messes up.  The problem is that something in the clay resists and the result isn\u2019t satisfactory to the craftsman.  However, as long as the clay is pliable in the master&#8217;s hands it can be remade into something just as beautiful and usable as the first version would have been.  It\u2019s somewhat sobering to read on.  The point Jeremiah\u2019s making is that, while the Potter is capable of salvaging the situation, the clay continues to resist.  The prophet says his people say, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point? We&#8217;ll live just the way we&#8217;ve always lived.&#8221;  God can handle their failure and rebellion.  He can remake them, bringing something good out of even this hopeless situation.  Sadly though, they won&#8217;t let him.  Today, I don\u2019t have to be a perfect person to be sculpted by the Master\u2019s hand.  However, I do have to be willing for that to happen.  I don&#8217;t come to God and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done a pretty good job on my life so far, how about you doing the finishing touches?&#8221;   Instead, I say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my life, the good and bad of it.  I place myself in your hands knowing you can remake me in a way that will be good.&#8221;  God save us from thinking our lives can&#8217;t be made new by his hand.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the hands of the Master Workman Jeremiah 18: In the same way that this potter works his clay, I work on you.
