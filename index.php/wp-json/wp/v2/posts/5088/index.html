It\u2019s his response to Job&#8217;s prayer of complaint that\u2019s interesting to me.  Job says that life is unfair and he wonders if there\u2019s something beyond this life where wrongs are made right.  As it is, he says, life for both good and bad people has way too much pain and sorrow.   Eliphaz hates what Job\u2019s saying so he calls him a &#8220;windbag,&#8221; and his words just so much &#8220;hot air.&#8221;  I doubt that Job is all that interested in hearing what Eliphaz has to say after that!  This isn&#8217;t exactly a deep, thoughtful response, but I can&#8217;t help but hear some exchanges between Christians in this.  Job has raised some valid points, but instead of responding to them, even in disagreement, Eliphaz insults him and then repeats what he\u2019s already said on the topic.  That sounds very much like the exchanges I&#8217;ve seen on the Internet.  In person, we\u2019re usually a bit more polite, but the end result is the same.  How do I respond when a fellow Christian brings up a point and comes to a conclusion that I hate?  Do I respond by insulting him and repeating what I&#8217;ve already said?  Do I attempt to understand why he believes as he does?  Eliphaz never imagined an Internet forum, but his style is alive and flourishing today.<br \/>\nTake Away: Learning to really listen to people with whom we disagree is an important part of our spiritual journey.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wonder which Internet forum Job visited?
