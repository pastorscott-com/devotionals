Still, I tend to think that Paul didn\u2019t tend to think of his own words in such lofty terms. We do, though. In the years following Paul\u2019s life his letters are painstakingly copied and passed around, church to church. As people gather to worship, his words are read to the congregation, shaping their theology and their faith. Today, I can read this passage to a congregation and no one will give much thought as to whether or not Paul\u2019s words are the \u201cwritten Word of God.\u201d Beyond all that, Paul tells us that these sacred words have a purpose. That purpose isn\u2019t to answer all my questions about science or culture or history. Rather, it\u2019s to show me \u201cthe way to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.\u201d To use it for other purposes is to abuse it. Rightly used, though, it trains \u201cus to live God\u2019s way.\u201d Today, I\u2019m reminded that this is the Word of the Lord, thanks be to God.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Let\u2019s never take God\u2019s Word for granted or use it for purposes for which it was not intended.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is the Word of the Lord 2Timothy 3: There\u2019s nothing like the written Word of God for showing you the way to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
