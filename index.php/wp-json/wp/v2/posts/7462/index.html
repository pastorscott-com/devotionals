He&#8217;s to cry out, warning people of impending danger.  If he does that, he&#8217;s done his job.  If he fails, then part of the blame for the loss is his own.  Ezekiel has done his job.  The book bearing his name contains page after page of his warnings which are given, sometimes, at considerable personal cost.  Had he failed in doing his part the story would be considerably different, in fact, I doubt we would have a book of Ezekiel at all.  God would have sought out another spokesman and it would be his name that would appear as the title of a book of the Bible. It could be that Ezekiel wasn&#8217;t God&#8217;s first choice, that he started by calling someone who&#8217;s unknown to us today.  Also, there&#8217;s the record of massive failure here that we do know about.  The failure is that of those who heard the warning and rejected it.  Ezekiel is God&#8217;s watchman for Israel and his faithfulness to that task is impressive.  I pray not only that the Lord will send a faithful watchman for my nation but that his or her message will be heard and heeded.<br \/>\nTake Away: All a person can do is be faithful to do what the Lord directs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Faithful watchman Ezekiel 33: You, son of man, are the watchman.
