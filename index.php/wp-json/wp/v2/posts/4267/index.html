Those events focus on both past and present blessings and touch on things like the Passover and on the harvest.  God\u2019s people are to remember his past blessings and appreciate the present ones.  The feasts include their making offerings but they\u2019re also to celebrate all the Lord\u2019s blessings on them.  These feasts connect God\u2019s people to God in their daily lives, reminding them of his provision for them in days gone by and in the current events of their lives as well.  This concept is not only good for the Israelites of centuries ago but is beneficial for you and me too.  Without such celebrations we tend to get lost in the everyday details of life and lose sight of the big picture of God\u2019s provision for, and connection to, our lives.  The specifics of those celebrations might look different for us than it did for them, but it has a similar impact on us.  Our celebrations might be a combination of civil and spiritual, like Christmas or New Year\u2019s or Thanksgiving or Mother\u2019s Day.  However, they may be quite \u201cChristian specific\u201d like Pentecost or Easter (the real deal, not the bunnies and new clothes version). Those celebrations might even be quite personal, like remembering the date of one\u2019s conversion or God\u2019s deliverance in one\u2019s life from some unwelcome event.  It\u2019s good to be reminded that even as we read the rules and regulations of Leviticus we find ourselves being ordered to remember and celebrate God\u2019s goodness to us.  It\u2019s in things like this that we find the spice of life.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is good to us and is active in our lives, we need to celebrate that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Party time Leviticus 23: Moses posted the calendar for the annual appointed feasts of God which Israel was to celebrate.
