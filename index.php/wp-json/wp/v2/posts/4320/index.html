A group of sisters, all daughters of the late Zelophehad appear before Moses to seek justice.  The division of land is by families and it\u2019s sons who are to inherit from their fathers.  These women explain that their father died without any sons and because of that his descendants are being left out of the plans for property ownership in Canaan.  Moses takes the issue to the Lord and the Lord agrees.  The plan is rewritten to take into account men who die with no sons to inherit their property.  This is a historical decision that elevates the status of women in Israel.  I find the circumstances quite interesting.  What would have happened had these women not come forward with their petition?  My guess is that their unique situation would have been overlooked.  As individuals, they would have been okay because when they married they would have shared in their husband\u2019s inheritance.  Because of their bold request, though, the Lord listened, agreed, and responded.  This then, becomes an example of prayer having a direct influence on the Lord.  He willingly listens to us and allows us to have influence in what he does in this world.  Had they not stepped forward things would have been okay; but because they did, things happened as they desired.  To think that the Almighty welcomes my petitions, considers them, and is willing to respond to them amazes me.  This is quite a powerful lesson to find buried here between the report of the census and more instructions concerning burnt offerings in the book of Numbers!<br \/>\nTake Away: As surprising as it is, the Lord welcomes my petitions and is willing to consider them and to grant them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Woman power Numbers 27: Give us an inheritance among our father\u2019s relatives.
