Jeremiah describes for us the devastating loss his people have suffered remarking, &#8220;Our dances have turned into dirges.&#8221;  In their miserable state they exclaim, &#8220;Would that we&#8217;d never sinned!&#8221;  That&#8217;s another statement that has been said many times.  As some unknown preacher said, &#8220;Sin will take you farther than you want to go.&#8221;  How many people have found themselves at the bottom, crushed by the consequences of their own sin?  For some reason we always think we&#8217;ll be the ones to get away with it, that we&#8217;ll beat the odds.  It never happens and sooner or later we add our voice to the chorus lamenting, &#8220;Would that we&#8217;d never sinned!&#8221;  It&#8217;s in that place, when everything seems hopeless that we can lift our faces to the God we&#8217;ve failed and pray, &#8220;Give us a fresh start.&#8221;  Our God is the God of Second Chances.  Even when I&#8217;ve messed my life up to the point that all is lost he can give me a fresh start.  That isn&#8217;t to say that he&#8217;ll press the rewind button on my life.  What&#8217;s done is done.  However, he&#8217;ll do something just as meaningful: he&#8217;ll make me into a new person.  When I&#8217;m weary of my sin and crushed by my failure, I can look to the God of Second Chances and ask him to give me a fresh start.  The Lord delights in answering that prayer.<br \/>\nTake Away: God is the God of Second Chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking up from the bottom Lamentations 5: Give us a fresh start.
