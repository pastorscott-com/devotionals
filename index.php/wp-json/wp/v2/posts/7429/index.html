Most of what I&#8217;d call the &#8220;personal&#8221; side of Ezekiel isn&#8217;t attractive to me.  Under God&#8217;s direction he does some pretty strange stuff and some of it must have been downright painful.  On the other side of the coin, though, are encounters like this one with the Glory of God.  I&#8217;m not saying I can read his words and come away with an accurate understanding of it all.  These are complex events and I&#8217;m sure I wouldn&#8217;t have done as good a job as he does in his attempt to describe his famous &#8220;wheels within wheels&#8221; or the sound of cherubim wings or the Voice like thunder or a sky-blue, sapphire colored throne.  I can&#8217;t grasp it all and I can&#8217;t help but feel a little jealous (is it okay to be jealous of another man&#8217;s vision?) of Ezekiel&#8217;s moment in the presence of God.  Still, I appreciate his allowing me to tag along as he encounters the Lord Almighty.  Even though I know I&#8217;m like a blind man in the presence of a rainbow, I still get just a faint sense of it all.  In this place I&#8217;m fearfully reverent and I know that there are depths to the Glory of God that I can&#8217;t hope to comprehend.  I still can&#8217;t grasp it all but thanks to Ezekiel I know more than I would otherwise.<br \/>\nTake Away: There are depths to the Glory of the Lord that I can&#8217;t hope to comprehend.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A visit to God\u2019s throne Ezekiel 10: Court and Temple were both filled with the blazing presence of the Glory of God.
