It\u2019s also the lynchpin of the Wisdom Literature in Scripture. By their very nature the Psalms are devotional reading. More often than not, as I read the Psalms I don\u2019t need a commentary as much as I need to listen to what\u2019s being said and then find ways to internalize it into my life. Many people do that by reading a Psalm each day as a part of their daily Bible reading. I don\u2019t intend to write a devotional on each Psalm. Instead, I encourage you to spend some time letting the Psalms feed your spirit. Perhaps the devotionals I do write will serve as primer to help you do that.<\/p>\n<p>Chewing on the word of God<br \/>\nPsalm 1: You chew on Scripture day and night.<br \/>\nThe book of Psalms is the world&#8217;s finest songbook. For centuries the Hebrew people turn to the Psalms and chant them as a part of their worship. Four part harmony hasn&#8217;t been invented yet, but they have the themes of worship down pat. Not only are the Psalms worship songs, they\u2019re often prayers too. They\u2019re not always high sounding and polished prayers. Often they\u2019re prayers from the heart and they reflect the entire range of human emotion. If I know a few things about harmony and chord progression that the Psalmists don&#8217;t know, I have to admit that the Psalmists know some things about absolute honesty with God that I need to learn. The first Psalm is a simple consideration of  the kind of people God likes. Right at the heart of it is the fact that God likes people who &#8220;chew on Scripture day and night.&#8221;  This goes way beyond doing my daily devotions and reading a bit of the Bible. Instead, it reaches down into my life as I take what I\u2019ve read and consider how it applies to what I\u2019m doing throughout the day. Today, I\u2019m reminded that God likes people who like his Word. That&#8217;s a fine reason to allow it to permeate my life.<br \/>\nTake Away: God likes people who like his Word.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Note to my readers: As most folks know, the Book of Psalms is the longest book of the Bible.
