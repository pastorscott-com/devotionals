Years ago when he failed God at Gilgal Samuel told him that God was finished with him. However for decades it has looked as though Saul can handle things on his own. He builds a strong army and successfully leads the people of Israel. However, through those years things are always going downhill for Saul. As we near the end of his story, he\u2019s a fear-filled, pitiful man. Thus we come to this strange incident at Endor. Saul&#8217;s afraid of his enemies and with good reason. His past successes against the Philistines are forgotten as a coalition of forces is massing for the biggest battle yet. Saul&#8217;s only connection with God has been through Samuel, but now Samuel is dead. Prayer is an unknown thing for Saul, but in fear, he prays. There\u2019s no answer. Then, with the same denial of God&#8217;s authority that was evident many years earlier when he decided to offer his own sacrifices rather than wait for Samuel at Gilgal, he again takes matters into his own hands. If God won&#8217;t answer, he\u2019ll turn to witchcraft for answers. He knows God strictly forbids this, in fact, as king he\u2019s enforced the abolition of witchcraft in Israel. Now, he goes looking for someone who can contact the dead for him, specifically Samuel. I know some view this as confirmation that witchcraft, mediums, s\u00e9ances, and the like can be genuine. However, I\u2019m not ready to go there based on this passage. The &#8220;witch at Endor&#8221; is probably an old faker who\u2019s told fortunes for years. Now, when she starts her act and Samuel appears she\u2019s more surprised than anyone else: &#8220;When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out&#8230;.&#8221; In other words, she dropped out of her mystic trance when something actually happened. My take on this is that Saul&#8217;s trying to bypass God by moving as far from God&#8217;s &#8220;territory&#8221; as possible. However, he runs headlong into God even there. Here\u2019s the spiritual fact of life: even when a person tries to move out of the light of God into areas where no one is to go they find that God is God even there. This passage is a confirmation of His absolute sovereignty.<br \/>\nTake Away: There\u2019s no way to bypass the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finding God in unexpected places 1 Samuel 28: There&#8217;s a witch at Endor.
