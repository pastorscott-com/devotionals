They love Jesus and they can\u2019t think of anything better than spending some quality time with him.  Mary is quite literal about that.  She stays in the room where Jesus is, hanging on his every word.  Martha, though, feels a sense of responsibility to make her guest comfortable.  In fact, she\u2019s frustrated with her sister for not pitching in and helping with the meal Martha\u2019s preparing in honor of Jesus and his disciples.  It\u2019s as she busies herself with these practical matters that frustration grows to the point that having Jesus there becomes secondary to her feeling of aggravation.   I can just imagine it: many people, including Mary, are in the living room listening to Jesus when the door bursts open and there stands Martha.  Without meaning to, she interrupts Jesus, demanding that he order Mary to help her.  Our Lord responds to her with an ever so gentle rebuke.  I\u2019m so glad that his rebuke is a gentle one because I identify with Martha.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m no cook and I\u2019m certainly not known for having the gift of hospitality.  However, I do sometimes get so focused on the nuts and bolts of things that I miss the big picture.  Maybe you\u2019re like that too.  Maybe you can\u2019t give yourself fully to the worship service because the guy running the video keeps getting the words out of sync.  Maybe you spot cobwebs under a pew or notice that one light bulb in the chandler is still burned out.  If you tend to focus on stuff like that you have to join me in appreciating the fact that the rebuke Jesus gives to Martha is, at least, a mild one.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Sometimes it takes a bit of self-discipline to focus on Jesus rather than some of the minor distractions of life.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gentle rebukes Luke 10: Martha, dear Martha, you\u2019re fussing far too much and getting yourself worked up over nothing.
