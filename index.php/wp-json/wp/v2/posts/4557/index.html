However, the Lord says it\u2019s time to get on with selecting Saul&#8217;s successor. This is potentially dangerous because Saul&#8217;s still in power and certainly doesn&#8217;t want Samuel anointing someone else as king. Still, Samuel obeys the Lord and heads out to the town of Bethlehem to find God&#8217;s choice for second king of Israel. There he finds the young man he\u2019s sure is the right one. It\u2019s Eliab, son of Jesse. Tall and good-looking, in fact, you might say &#8220;regal&#8221; in appearance. But Samuel is mistaken. God reminds him that this isn&#8217;t a beauty contest and that God\u2019s more interested in what is in the heart than he is in outward appearance. Eliab might be a fine fellow but he isn&#8217;t to be the next king of Israel. The search continues as Jessie brings one son after another before the revered man of God. Finally, all but one son has been interviewed. Young David is all that\u2019s left. When Saul was chosen we were told that he stood a head and shoulders above the other men. Now, as David is picked, he\u2019s called the &#8220;runt&#8221; of the family. Thus we gain an insight into how God works. He uses big, nice looking people, but he also uses those that others tend to overlook. Why? It\u2019s because God looks on the heart. I pray that the Lord will find in me a person he can use for his purposes.<br \/>\nTake Away: Since the Lord looks on the heart, let\u2019s do all we can to keep our hearts right with the Lord.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Would you like to super-size that order?
