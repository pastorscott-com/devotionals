Things are going to change in a glorious day to come.  Through the centuries the Lord has sent gifted leaders to Israel.  He&#8217;s given them the Law upon which to build their civilization and a beautiful Temple in which to worship.  He\u2019s given them a land of their own and has been with them through their many ups and downs.  Still, failure has dominated them.  They&#8217;ve tossed all their advantages aside and have paid a terrible price for doing so.  Ezekiel says that things are going to change.  The change won&#8217;t come because some new national leader leads them back to God.  It won&#8217;t come by God&#8217;s restating his laws to them, and it won&#8217;t come simply because they try harder to please the Lord.  The change will be at the core of their lives.  The Lord says he&#8217;s going to give them a new heart.   Under this new arraignment self-centered living will give way to God-centered living.  Their very affections will be transformed.  The result will be a people fully connected to God.  I love this portion of scripture because I believe the message is not only for these ancient Israelites, but for God&#8217;s people today.  For every Christian who battles inner battles, who struggles with living wholly for God, this is a wonderful word of hope.  The Lord&#8217;s not only in the sin forgiving business &#8212; he&#8217;s in the heart transforming business as well.  We find hope for a deeper, heart changing work of God in this passage.  Throughout the years Christians have read this message and come away with a prayer on their lips: &#8220;Lord, do that for me &#8211; do it in me &#8211; today.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord not only forgives sins: he transforms lives as well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God&#8217;s in the heart transforming business Ezekiel 36: I&#8217;ll&#8230;replace it with a heart that&#8217;s God-willed, not self-willed.
