And they just keep on bringing these items.  Finally, the craftsmen go to Moses with a problem.   They have too much stuff!  Moses\u2019 solution is to tell them to stop.  I can\u2019t help but smile as I read this story because such an order is rare or maybe even non-existent in the Church today.   However, there are a couple of things to consider.
