When they fail to completely drive out the people of the land the Lord leaves that pagan culture there and uses it to develop the Israelites into the people he wants them to be.  The remaining Canaanites become the &#8220;alternative choice&#8221; for the Israelites.  I see a parallel in my own culture.  I believe the Lord intends that the Church be the dominant force in society.  Sadly, in many cases it fails.  The result is that there\u2019s a thriving alternative secular culture in the land.  This culture has no place for God (or at least wants God to mind his own business).  Every day God\u2019s people are exposed to the values of this self-oriented, market-driven, materialistic society.  As it was for the Israelites of the Book of Judges the people of God must decide \u201cwho I will serve.&#8221;<br \/>\nTake Away: No doubt the popular culture is, well, popular \u2013 sometimes God\u2019s people have to journey the less traveled road.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s your call Judges 2: That&#8217;s why God let those nations remain.
