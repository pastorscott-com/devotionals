Around 100 years earlier God sent Jonah to preach condemnation to Nineveh, but in hopes that they would repent and be spared.  Jonah would have been happy to preach the message of God\u2019s judgment if that was all there was to it.  Now, two generations later Nahum is given that message.  \u201cThe problem of Nineveh\u201d is that the Assyrian empire is the superpower of the region.  The tiny nation of Judah is in fearful awe of that empire and behind every move they make is the question, \u201cWill this be okay with the powers that be in the Assyrian capitol of Nineveh?\u201d  Nahum\u2019s call from God is to reorient the priorities of Judah.   He\u2019s to tell his people that God is still God and that Nineveh will be held to the same standards as the other nations of the world.  The prophet goes to work proclaiming his message.  In the first part of his sermon he reminds them that, as mighty as Assyria might be, the Lord is the \u201cAll-mighty.\u201d  God\u2019s a patient God, but, in the end, he\u2019s also Judge of the world.  To him, Assyria is just another nation and they\u2019re about to be called to account for their abuse of power.  My nation is on the Assyrian side of things.  We\u2019re the superpower and, to borrow an old saying, \u201cwhen America sneezes the whole world gets a bad cold.\u201d  As I read from the little Book of Nahum I\u2019m reminded that in God\u2019s eyes we\u2019re not as big a deal as we think we are.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s important for us as individuals and as a nation to remember that the Lord is the \u201cAll-Mighty.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not thinking too highly of ourselves Nahum 1: A report on the problem of Nineveh.
