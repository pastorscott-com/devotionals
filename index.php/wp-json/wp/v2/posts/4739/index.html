First, he challenges the prophets of Baal to a &#8220;god-contest&#8221; and wins a decisive victory when, as a result of his prayer, fire falls from heaven. The people are now convinced that &#8220;the Lord is God.&#8221; Then, he turns his attention to the three-year drought. He prevails in prayer and, as a result, the rain comes in a great storm. Finally, empowered by the Spirit of God, Elijah outruns the chariot of Ahab, racing down the mountain into the city. Tell you what, I call that a good day&#8217;s work! Ahab arrives home in the midst of the welcome storm, but the news for his Baal-worshipping, God-hating wife Jezebel isn\u2019t good. All because of Elijah Baal has been defeated and his prophets executed. Jezebel never hesitates; she sends word to Elijah that he\u2019ll be next. In a surprising twist, her words terrify Elijah! This is the guy who prayed down fire on the altar and rain from the sky. This is the guy who saw to the execution of hundreds of false prophets. Now, because of the threats of one woman he runs for his life. I\u2019d expect Elijah to just pray down a bit more fire and take care of this wicked woman then and there. Why on earth is Elijah scared witless by Jezebel? I think the answer is that he\u2019s simply out of gas. Intense praying, especially intercession requires of us all our energy. Sometimes prayer is pictured as a tranquil respite from the pressures of life, and, happily, sometimes it is. Still, that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes prayer is the hardest work we\u2019ll ever do. Such prayer is worth doing in spite of its emotional, spiritual, and even physical price. In this, we\u2019re soldiers in the army of God who have an active, demanding assignment.<br \/>\nTake Away: Prayer can be the most rewarding, exhausting work we\u2019ll ever do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praying to exhaustion 1Kings 19: When Elijah saw how things were, he ran for dear life.
