Peter has no money but he does have faith in Jesus\u2019 power to heal.  By that faith the man is wonderfully healed.  This healing causes quite a commotion and a crowd gathers.  It\u2019s now that Peter brings a quick sermon giving Jesus all the glory for the healing and calling on his listeners to put their faith in this Jesus who makes a real difference in people\u2019s lives.  As I watch all this unfold I can\u2019t help but wonder how good a job I do of giving Jesus the credit.  Here\u2019s what I think: Christians do a wonderful job of giving the Lord credit for organized, intentional ministries.  We make sure that people helped through official channels know that we\u2019re ministering to them in Jesus\u2019 name.  On the other hand, I don\u2019t think we do a very good job when we minister in unofficial ways.  I fear that often people just think we\u2019re nice folks because we take it for granted that they know we\u2019re acting as representatives of Jesus.  We need to develop a better strategy along these lines.  I need to come up with a line to say when, for instance, I stop to help my neighbor carry some bit of heavy trash to the curb for pickup.  When he says \u201cthanks\u201d I need to be ready to say something about my being a follower of Jesus and I just try to do stuff I think he\u2019d do.  It may not always be appropriate and it\u2019s probably not a time for me to preach a sermon like Peter does in this passage, but then again, helping carry a worn out clothes dryer to the curb isn\u2019t as big a deal as healing someone like he did.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Christians need a strategy for giving Jesus the credit for simple acts of kindness they do it his name.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Giving credit where credit is due Acts 3: Faith and nothing but faith put this man healed and whole right before your eyes.
