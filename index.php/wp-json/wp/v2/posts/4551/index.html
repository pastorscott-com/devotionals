He became invincible!<br \/>\nSaul is a terrific military leader: brave, capable, and resourceful. My first instinct upon reading Samuel&#8217;s pronouncement of God&#8217;s rejection of Saul as king is to think that everything\u2019s going to fall apart for him. It simply doesn&#8217;t happen. Saul builds a great army, extends his rule by taking more territory, and keeps the hated Philistines on the defense. For decades he successfully leads Israel. Whether I like it or not, sometimes godless people are very capable people. For instance, all it takes is watching the innovative, yet profane commercials during a Super Bowl to see that some of the brightest, most outstanding people in advertising are those who have anything but Christian values. So, as I read his story, I see that at on at least the public level, Saul has it all together. It\u2019s at the private level that things are, indeed, falling apart. Without doubt, living for the Lord is the best way to live. Still, being a follower of Jesus doesn&#8217;t make one smarter or more capable. That ought to at least humble me and make me more dependent on the Lord. It may also make me think twice when I\u2019m picking a professional to help me with my business or getting ready to pull the lever to vote in an important election.<br \/>\nTake Away: Some of the smartest, most capable people we know aren\u2019t Christians \u2013 at least, not yet.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thinking about leadership 1 Samuel 14: Wherever he turned, he came up with a victory.
