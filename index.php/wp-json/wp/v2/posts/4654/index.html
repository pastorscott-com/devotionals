Twenty thousand soldiers fall that day in bloody one-on-one fighting in the most tragic kind of war: brother against brother. Absalom flees but in an ironic twist of fate, it\u2019s his hair, apparently his most prized feature, which brings about his downfall. As his mule gallops under a tree his hair is entangled in the branches. He hangs there, helpless before his enemies. Knowing that David has forbidden the killing of his son, some are afraid to act, but one of his generals, Joab, kills him and then others join in making sure he is dead. When word comes to David his heart is broken and he mourns the death of his son. To Joab and maybe to us this is downright silly. Absalom murdered his brother, tried to take his father&#8217;s throne and life, and is responsible for the deaths of twenty thousand good men. Still, David is deeply saddened by the failure of his son &#8212; possibly thinking of what might have been. I think David&#8217;s response to Absalom&#8217;s death is a reflection of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s sadness over the wasted lives of those who live in rebellion against him. He mourns the spiritual failure of those who have followed Absalom&#8217;s example to tragic ruin.<br \/>\nTake Away: The Lord wants all people to be saved \u2013 and, actually, it\u2019s not as though any of us deserves to be saved, it\u2019s all by his love and grace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>They told me men shouldn\u2019t have long hair 2 Samuel 19: O my son Absalom, Absalom my dear, dear son!
