The armies of Edom, Israel, and Judah plan to circle around and attack from an unexpected direction. However, it all backfires. They find themselves a day out of Moab and in the desert having exhausted their supply of water. Jehoshaphat asks for a prophet of God and Elisha &#8220;just happens&#8221; to be nearby. God&#8217;s word through Elisha is that they\u2019re to begin digging ditches in this desert plain because, without a single drop of rain falling on them, God will fill those ditches with water. Many years earlier Elisha&#8217;s predecessor had prayed for rain and, when a cloud &#8220;the size of a man&#8217;s hand&#8221; appeared on the horizon he stopped praying and started running in preparation for the rain storm that was coming. Now, Elisha promises water, but tells them that they need to start preparing for it before they see even the first drop. Obviously there\u2019s a pattern here and in many other instances in God&#8217;s Word. God expects us to act in faith that he\u2019ll keep his word to us. For Elijah that meant he needed to stop praying and start running. For this army it means that out in the arid, dusty desert they\u2019re to prepare for flowing water. How does this principle apply to my life today?<br \/>\nTake Away: Our acts of faith really do have a bearing on what the Lord does for us and through us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ditch digging for the Lord 2Kings 3: Dig ditches all over this valley.
