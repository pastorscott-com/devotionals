Their background as slaves affords these Israelites little preparation of combat.  King Amalek, on the other hand, is a fighter with a trained and disciplined army.  He sees the Israelites as easy prey and attacks them.  The thing he doesn\u2019t know is that Israel is under the protection of God Almighty.  God\u2019s man, Moses, climbs to a high point and raises that famous staff to the Lord.  When he does, it\u2019s almost as though God\u2019s power flows from heaven, through that staff, into Moses, and then out to those defending the nation.  These slaves fight like soldiers.  However, Moses\u2019 arms grow weary and he lowers the staff.  When he does, the tide of the battle turns and Amalek\u2019s forces begin to gain the advantage.  Two men, Aaron and Hur, come to the rescue.  They provide Moses a place to sit and then they hold up his arms and staff.  Victory is theirs.  As I read this story I see that God&#8217;s teaching them that (in the words of Jesus) \u201cApart from me you can do nothing.\u201d  Their victory on this day is clearly linked to Moses, the staff, and the action of Aaron and Hur.  It\u2019s a great victory, the first of many, but there\u2019s no way they can take credit for it.  Also, I can\u2019t help but comment on the support of Aaron and Hur.  Neither is God\u2019s man for this moment.  Clearly, that\u2019s Moses.  However, they become literal \u201csupporters\u201d of God\u2019s man, lifting him when he can\u2019t go on.  Generally speaking, that\u2019s our role in life too.  We lend our support to those God is using in unique ways.  In so doing, we play a small role in the big deal of God\u2019s work in this world.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s nice to have a part to play, even when it\u2019s mainly just supportive of others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having a small role in a big deal Exodus 17: But Moses\u2019 hands got tired.
