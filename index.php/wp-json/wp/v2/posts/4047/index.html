Who on earth (or beyond this earth) are these sons of God? Do we have some angels coming to earth and being attracted to our women? Now that would make for some juicy sermon material! Alas, I don\u2019t think it will work. We don\u2019t find any evidence in the Bible of angels being called \u201csons of God.\u201d Still, the writer of Genesis says that the result of the union of these mysterious sons of God and the daughters of men is a race of giants: big, aggressive, and conquering. I think the best way to work on this passage is to read it backwards. That is, the result of all this is that God concludes that \u201chuman evil is out of control.\u201d The rebellion that started with Adam and Eve has gotten progressively worse to the point that humanity is focused on evil all the time. A branch of the human race has sprung up that threatens God\u2019s plan to redeem human beings. The part about sons of God is how the writer introduces this accelerating fall of humanity. Now, having put it into perspective, the identity of these sons of God isn\u2019t quite as important as it was. It\u2019s just the set up describing why God is about to take drastic action against humanity. It may be that the writer is simply giving us a poetic view of how a race of \u201cmighty men\u201d who have no fear of God came dominate the earth. I do have a theory that I\u2019ll share with you, but its pure speculation. I think the sons of God are the descendants of Seth. It\u2019s through him that the Son of God will trace his lineage. It\u2019s Seth\u2019s offspring who are listed as living those extremely long lives in the previous chapter. I also think the \u201cdaughters of men\u201d are the offspring of Cain. That murderer was driven out and is no longer counted as one of God\u2019s people. Just because Cain and his descendants are considered to be outsiders doesn\u2019t mean they fade to nothing. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. They\u2019re building cities, developing the arts, and bringing the world into the Bronze Age. You might say that humanity has forked into two distinct groups: those who worship God (sons of God) and those who advance humanity apart from God. When the God-worshipers start intermarrying with these humanists the Lord decides he must act aggressively to save humanity. At least that\u2019s my take on it all.<br \/>\nTake away: God will act aggressively to redeem humanity\u2026that\u2019s true in broad terms, but also at the personal level as well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Those mysterious sons of God Genesis 6: The sons of God noticed that the daughters of men were beautiful.
