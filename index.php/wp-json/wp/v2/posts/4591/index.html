David and his men have retreated to En Gedi, an area with lots of good places in which to hide. Saul has received a tip concerning David&#8217;s location, so he and his army are working through the region, searching for David. Saul knows he\u2019s closing in on David, but has no idea of how close he actually is. Then, as happens at inopportune times, nature calls. There are no rest stops in the area, so Saul picks a convenient cave for privacy, dismisses his aids, and enters by himself, never guessing that David and his men (likely a patrol and not the whole 600) are hidden farther back in the cave. Talk about catching a man with his pants down! At this point it will be very easy for David to strike Saul down. His men see this as a golden opportunity to kill Saul, but David sees it as a chance to show mercy and to prove his respect for the person God placed at the head of the nation of Israel. David cuts off a piece of Saul&#8217;s laid aside robe. Then, as Saul rejoins his troops, David appears at the mouth of the cave Saul has just departed. The fringe of the robe proves that David has spared Saul&#8217;s life and, temporarily at least, Saul&#8217;s heart melts. Centuries later one of David&#8217;s descendants will declare the principle that directed David&#8217;s action that day. He said, &#8220;Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you.&#8221; Before the Sermon on the Mount was ever preached David illustrated it at the cave in En Gedi.<br \/>\nTake Away: Doing the right thing sometimes means we let a golden opportunity to force the issue pass by.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Close encounters of the Third Kind 1 Samuel 24: There was a cave there and Saul went in to relieve himself.
