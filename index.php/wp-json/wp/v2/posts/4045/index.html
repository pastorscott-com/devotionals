And he died.<br \/>\nI\u2019ve heard that the very long lives of people mentioned in the first pages of Genesis are the result of someone\u2019s counting the seasons as years or something like that. While I have no authority to say it, I\u2019ll say it anyway: I think that\u2019s silly. Based on the Creation story, I think the Lord designed human beings to live forever. It\u2019s their disobedience that brings death into the world. In fact, this very moment the only man already possessing a resurrection body is still alive 2000 years down the road. He\u2019s physically at the right hand of his Father right now. Sin short-circuited the \u201cforever aspect\u201d of human life and it\u2019s Jesus who redeems, not just the souls of people, but our bodies as well. At this point, Jesus is the only man to experience the redeemed body, but judging from his post-resurrection appearances the new body is a fascinating mix of familiar (eating) and unfamiliar (appearing and disappearing). Now, back to Adam. I think his extremely long life is a residue of his original design. If you think about it, his body was designed for eternity and he \u201conly\u201d lived 930 years. Soon, God will move to further limit life spans, not once, but twice. The original limitation, though, is the big one. Because of sin, life expectancy is throttled back from forever to under 1000 years. For a creature intended to live forever that\u2019s like dying in infancy.<br \/>\nTake away: Jesus redeems us entirely, body and spirit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>He died before his time Genesis 5: Adam lived a total of 930 years.
