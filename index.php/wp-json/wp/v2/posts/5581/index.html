They could have done a better job; treated people the way good and dedicated shepherds treat the sheep under their care.  They haven&#8217;t done that and the Lord\u2019s not only angry with them but he has another approach in mind.  This plan will provide quality leadership to his people.  David is considered the prototype king for Israel and the coming Leader will be cut from the same cloth as was David.  He\u2019ll be a descendant of David.  He\u2019ll also be strong, wise, and dedicated to God.  That kind of man will take care of God&#8217;s people.  In Jeremiah&#8217;s future and in my past that Leader makes his appearance.  He does everything Jeremiah says he will.  He\u2019s a righteous man of justice and he goes to work fixing all that sin has broken.  He\u2019s worthy of the name Jeremiah gives him: &#8220;God-Who-Puts-Everything-Right.&#8221;  The process started by this Leader isn\u2019t yet complete, but we already see that everything he touches is changed for the better.  Well, better put, &#8220;everyone he touches.&#8221;   In fact, I can say that I not only believe in this Leader&#8217;s ability to transform lives &#8212; my own life is an example of his work.  I&#8217;m not all I&#8217;m going to be, but by his grace, I&#8217;m not what I would have been.<br \/>\nTake Away: In Christ we find restoration and transformation. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Quality leadership Jeremiah 23: This is the name they&#8217;ll give him: &#8220;God-Who-Puts-Everything-Right.&#8221; The religious leaders are a disappointment to God.
