Everyone, pastor-types and regular church folks, leans forward to listen to what he has to say. What&#8217;s of first importance? What is Timothy to believe in first of all? Paul zeros in on prayer. For this young pastor the lynchpin of his ministry isn\u2019t preaching well-constructed, well-delivered sermons. It\u2019s not church administration or solid doctrine or even visitation. He\u2019s to be a man of prayer &#8212; an expert at it. Paul wants him to pray for people he knows and for people he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s to pray for their salvation and, if they have authority, to pray that they\u2019ll rule successfully, maintaining peace in the land. Paul sets for Timothy an example and now Timothy is to set an example for his congregation at Ephesus. As a result, the men and the women in his congregation will focus on prayer. Let\u2019s take these instructions to heart. Let\u2019s \u201cpray every way we know how.\u201d Let\u2019s remember that prayer \u201cis at the bottom\u201d of everything we do. Who knows what might happen as God\u2019s called ministers and their congregations give themselves to fervent, persistent, faith-filled prayer!<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Prayer is to be our number one agenda item.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pastoral priority 1Timothy 2: The first thing I want you to do is pray.
