The clock is ticking and soon their world will be rocked in ways they can\u2019t imagine.  Still, there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.  As a result of all that\u2019s coming they\u2019ll do even greater things than what they\u2019ve seen Jesus do.  I think Jesus is speaking to them as a cooperate group and not as individuals.  They won\u2019t all go out and be messiahs in the world, but together, as the Church, they\u2019ll transform the world in the Name of Jesus.  They won\u2019t be alone in their task.  Jesus is sending the Holy Spirit, his Spirit, who\u2019ll not only be with them but will be in them, empowering them to do his work.  When they run up against impossible situations that threaten to stop them from carrying on his work, all they\u2019ll need to do is call out to him and he\u2019ll make the impossible possible for them.  This \u201casking in Jesus\u2019 Name\u201d isn\u2019t an open credit card that they can use for doing anything they want.  Rather, this is all about ministry empowerment.  Jesus wants them to carry on his work in this world, bringing the Good News of the Gospel to every nation.  He promises them power for the task and he tells them that he\u2019ll never be more than a prayer away.  This may not be an all-purpose \u201ccredit card\u201d but it is, I think, a mighty fine \u201cMaster\u2019s Card\u201d that I need to use more often.<\/p>\n<p>Take Away: Jesus has provided us exactly what we need to do his work in this world.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t leave home without it John 14: Whatever you request along the lines of who I am and what I am doing, I\u2019ll do it.
