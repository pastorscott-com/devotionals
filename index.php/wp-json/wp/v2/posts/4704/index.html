But, because of his lack of self-control in relation to the opposite sex he becomes a miserable failure before God. My society seems to think God keeps a sort of balance sheet on our lives. Therefore, the goal is to do more good things than bad things. If a person attains that goal, they\u2019ll make it to heaven. Solomon&#8217;s story teaches us better. His failure isn&#8217;t that he destroys the Temple or begins writing bad proverbs. Instead, it\u2019s that he disobeys God. One act of disobedience destroys a lifetime of obedience. We all stand in need of God&#8217;s grace, and if we make it to heaven it will be because of that grace. Still, God requires obedience. A lifetime of accomplishment can&#8217;t atone for even one act of disobedience.<br \/>\nTake Away: It\u2019s worth repeating: a lifetime of accomplishment can\u2019t atone for even one act of disobedience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Close only counts in horseshoes 1Kings 11: Solomon faithlessly disobeyed God&#8217;s orders.
