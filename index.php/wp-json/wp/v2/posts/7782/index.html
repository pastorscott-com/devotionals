Zechariah is right there with him calling for the reconstruction of the place of worship.  In fact, long after Haggai has disappeared from the world stage we find Zechariah still proclaiming God\u2019s message.  Zechariah is an encourager to his people, reminding them that, as his name means: \u201cThe Lord remembers.\u201d  He wants them to know that God remembers the promises he made to their ancestors and that they can depend on him to keep those promises.  His book starts with very good news as the Lord says to them, \u201cCome back to me and I\u2019ll come back to you.\u201d  One doesn\u2019t have to have lived 2500 years ago to be stirred by these words.  The Lord isn\u2019t a hard, unforgiving Judge who&#8217;s out to destroy us.  Instead, he\u2019s compassionate and merciful; patiently inviting us to respond to his message of hope.  Again, I don\u2019t have to be one of the ancient returned exiles to be thrilled with this invitation.  In Christ, that invitation is enhanced and God\u2019s intense desire is made even clearer.  When I turn to the Lord I find that he\u2019s already met me more than half way \u2013 that happened on a hill called Calvary.<br \/>\nTake Away: When we come to the Lord we find that, not only is he willing to forgive us, but that he loves showing us mercy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>God\u2019s gracious offer Zechariah 1: Come back to me and I\u2019ll come back to you.
