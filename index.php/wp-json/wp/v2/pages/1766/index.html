My wife of over 50 years, Jackie, and I lived in Alvin, Texas from 1999 to our retirement in 2013 where I was the lead pastor of the Church of the Nazarene.\u00a0 After retirement we traveled full time in our RV for about 9 years, enjoying seeing the country and experiencing a different pace of life as retirees.\u00a0 I have also accepted some extended assignments as interim pastor, helping churches that are in pastoral transition.\u00a0In July of 2022 we began a new Adventure, embarking on a year-long stay in Manchester, England where we volunteered at Nazarene Theological College.\u00a0 These days we have &#8220;retired&#8221; from our travels and are comfortably settled down near family and friends. \u00a0 We write about our adventures in our <a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/travel\/\">Here and There \/ Scott and Jackie&#8217;s Travels<\/a> blog.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005 I was thinking about ways to enhance time I spent in God\u2019s Word. Through the years I had read the Bible in various translations, used different devotional guides, etc. I felt that rather than reading several pages each day that I needed to slow down and reflect more on what I was reading.<\/p>\n<p>Writing has always been a way for me to think through things. As I prepare sermons I don\u2019t write a manuscript, but I do a lot of writing which helps me organize my thoughts. I decided I would read my Bible each day until something caught my attention. At that point I would stop reading and write my thoughts about it.<\/p>\n<p>At first, these were strictly personal thoughts, and I had no intention of making them public. However, I ultimately decided that by posting them online I would not only be sharing my thoughts but I would have a thumb in my back to keep writing. I ended up posting the devotionals to not only my blog but to Facebook and Google+ as well.<\/p>\n<p>A few years later,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20191103114647\/http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/index.php\/books-by-pastor-scott\/\">I self published my devotionals<\/a>, ultimately in four volumes. I basically gave them away, setting the prices at the minimum allowed. Several have bought the books, but many more read them daily online.<\/p>\n<p>When I finally came to the end of Revelation I decided to go back to Genesis, repeating the devotionals day by day, sometimes editing them for clarity or just to fix a typo.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to all who have read, made occasional comments on Facebook, and clicked on Facebook \u201clike.\u201d Your words of encouragement are a real blessing to me.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-large;\"><strong>My Pages<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<hr width=\"90%\" \/>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/20220530_204025-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16463\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/20220530_204025-6-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\">Devotionals and Photography from Pastor Scott<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Short devotionals from my <a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/index.php\/books-by-pastor-scott\/\">Coffee Break Devotional series<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/P2028657.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-10245 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/P2028657-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"P2028657\" width=\"144\" height=\"115\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/P2028657-300x239.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/P2028657.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/index.php\/books-by-pastor-scott\/\">Books by Pastor Scott<\/a><\/p>\n<p>All four books in the series are available in print and e-book formats.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pastorscott.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/Quill-Pen-150x104.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"104\" \/><a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/speaking\/\">Pastor Scott&#8217;s Ministerially Speaking<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Church related topics ranging from entire sanctification to words of appreciation to dedicated lay people to the observations of a retired church visiting pastor.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-MbZ6l5QCoDA\/XX7YIQ1ZVlI\/AAAAAAABBFg\/qvSI3JsNR0wOSSQqJ9VO4qEtStI8DPE9wCKgBGAsYHg\/s1600\/IMG_20190627_172732.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"104\" \/><a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/speaking\/\">Here and There with Scott and Jackie<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our RV travel blog.\u00a0 You&#8217;ll find everything from campground reviews to sightseeing tips here.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to\u00a0PastorScott.com.\u00a0 I am Pastor Scott Cundiff.
