The Lord, reaching out<br>
Jeremiah 31: Everything in me cries out for him. Softly and tenderly I wait for him.<br>
In this passage the tribe of Ephraim represents the people of Israel.  Jeremiah imagines Israel humbly coming to the Lord, asking if it&#8217;s too late and wondering if the Lord can ever embrace her again.  God&#8217;s answer is immediate and compassionate.  The Lord says that that’s all he’s wanted to hear all along and that the strong medicine was administered not because he had stopped loving Israel but preciously because of his love.  This great God of love has longed for his people to return to him and with great tenderness he waits to receive them back to himself.  I can’t help but respond to this passage in a personal way.  I’m moved by God&#8217;s compassion on, not only ancient Israel, but on the lost people of my day.  When I’m in rebellion against God he longs for my return; reaching out to me, crying out in love.  Today, I stand in awe of the mercy, grace, and compassion of God for a lost human race.<br>
Take Away: God is love.</p>

God’s Law in my heart<br>
Jeremiah 31: I will put my law within them &#8212; write it on their hearts!<br>
I love this statement.  Jeremiah sees the sin and rebellion of his people, not as a cultural or educational or behavioral problem, but as a heart problem.  Their failure isn&#8217;t the result of misunderstanding and it isn&#8217;t a mistake.  They sin because they’re sinners at heart.  The great need of their lives isn’t that they straighten up and act right.  They need heart surgery; a change at the very foundation of their being.  In this passage the Lord describes this change.  On the first level, it’s a change that will take place following the Babylonian exile but on a larger scale it’s a change Jesus, the Son of God, will bring.  In fact, the writer of the New Testament book of Hebrews returns to this passage to describe the new spiritual reality Christ has brought into the world.  God&#8217;s Law is no longer written on stone tablets.  Rather, it’s written on the hearts of those who receive Jesus as their Lord and Savior.  Jeremiah sees the need and he has the promise from God that the need will be met, but he can’t imagine how it will all be brought about.<br>
Take Away: We need more than to change our behavior – we need for our hearts to be transformed by the grace of the Lord.</p>

Death sentence reprieve<br>
Jeremiah 31: I&#8217;ll wipe the slate clean for each of them. I&#8217;ll forget that they ever sinned.<br>
A few years ago I developed an itching rash on the lower right side of my back.  I had some other stuff going on so when I went to the doctor I asked him about it.  He took one look at it and said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got shingles.&#8221;  I thought, &#8220;Shingles?  Old people get that!&#8221;  Honestly, at the time, I didn&#8217;t worry too much about it.  I could handle the itching.  However, I had no idea of the journey I was about to take.  The itching gave way to sleepless nights of burning pain.  For days I was homebound, unable to get dressed.  Now, at the beginning, I knew something was wrong but I thought it was going to be a minor inconvenience.  Only in the mid-term of the illness did I grasp just how bad things were.  I&#8217;ve seriously wondered if Job was given a full body version of shingles.  When the Lord tells me I&#8217;m a sinner my reaction is something like what I had at the doctor&#8217;s office.  It&#8217;s too bad; I&#8217;ll have to try harder to clean up my act.  What I don&#8217;t realize is that I&#8217;ve just been given a death sentence.  This isn&#8217;t just bad news; it&#8217;s the worst news possible.  It’s only in this light that statements like the one I&#8217;m reading from Jeremiah carry the force they’re supposed to.  Otherwise, we have God just helping us along in doing what we can pretty much handle for ourselves.   When I realize that being a sinner is to be broken beyond repair; to be, for all intents and purposes dead already; and when I realize that God, in his mercy is willing to &#8220;wipe the slate clean&#8221; and to &#8220;forget&#8221; it all&#8230;well, it’s then that I begin to grasp the meaning of grace.<br>
Take Away: Thank the Lord for his grace – without it, there’s no hope whatsoever.</p>

Business, but not quite “as usual”<br>
Jeremiah 32: I will restore everything that was lost.<br>
When I think of parts of the Bible that were written in jail it’s the Apostle Paul and several letters of his from the New Testament that come to mind.  However, many years earlier Jeremiah was locked up and continued to declare his messages from God.  In this case Jeremiah is in jail for insisting that the invading Babylonian army is going to be successful.  He urges everyone to surrender and take their punishment.  Even as he&#8217;s proclaiming this message, the Lord tells him that he needs to conduct some family business.  It must have seemed odd to his fellow prisoners to see this man who’s been saying their nation is about to fall stop to buy some land from a relative of his.  If everyone’s going to be taken away as Jeremiah claims, why in the world would he take time to buy property?  Jeremiah does his business and then asks that the deed and other paperwork be sealed in a jar and buried.  That deed won&#8217;t be of any use for a long time but someday it’ll be dug up and still be good when God&#8217;s people return to their homeland many years hence.  Even as Jeremiah proclaims coming disaster he does so with hope for a brighter future.  Today, my message may, at times, be more negative than positive.  My nation can&#8217;t expect to continue down the God-ignoring road it’s on and think that God won&#8217;t notice.  Still, though, my message should, in general, be a positive one.  What happened at Calvary brings the hope of salvation to the whole human race.  Even when there&#8217;s plenty to be concerned about, that&#8217;s the really big news.<br>
Take Away: What happened at Calvary brings the hope of salvation to the whole human race.</p>

God’s last word<br>
Jeremiah 33: The last word is, I will have mercy on them.<br>
This phrase is the conclusion of another of Jeremiah&#8217;s &#8220;prison epistles.&#8221;  King Zedekiah feels he can&#8217;t have Jeremiah preaching defeat even as their enemies have their city under siege so he’s thrown Jeremiah into jail.  It’s interesting that the prophet&#8217;s focus turns away from &#8220;right now&#8221; to looking to a much brighter day.  In the future the people of Israel and Judah will return to this land.  At that time the Lord will do &#8220;marvelous and wondrous things&#8221; for them (that is, their descendants).  God has made some specific promises to this nation and even though, right now, it seems that everything’s falling apart, God has never lost sight of those promises.  It’ll all start with the return of the people of Israel to this land.  Every promise the Lord has given them will be fulfilled.  While it’s true that things are going to get worse before they get better, it is just as true that things will get better; in fact, better than they can imagine.  Right now it seems that God&#8217;s anger and dismissal of them will be their epitaph, but it isn&#8217;t so.  Jeremiah says that in the end, when everything’s being summed up that the conclusion to it all will be that God has had mercy on them.  Getting from where they are to that wonderful conclusion isn&#8217;t going to be easy, but in the end, when all’s said and done, it’ll be clear that everything that happened was an act of divine mercy.  It&#8217;s hard to see the big picture when I’m in the middle of things that aren&#8217;t going to suit me.  At times like that I have to simply trust the character of God: that he’s a good and merciful God who loves me.  The last word concerning God&#8217;s dealings with me will be: &#8220;mercy.&#8221;<br>
Take Away: Thank the Lord for his unfathomable mercy.</p>

Playing “let’s make a deal” with God<br>
Jeremiah 34: The army of the king of Babylon has pulled back&#8230;but not for long.<br>
One of the many acts of rebellion against God committed by Judah is that of making slaves of their fellow countrymen.  God forbade this from the very beginning of their existence as a nation, even as they came up out of Egyptian slavery.  Indentured servitude, yes – slavery, no.  With things falling apart as Babylon&#8217;s army’s about to take the city of Jerusalem King Zedekiah frees all the salves.  It appears that he’s playing &#8220;let&#8217;s make a deal&#8221; with God.  In fact, the Lord seems to agree to the deal.  Nebuchadnezzar withdraws his army and for the time being Jerusalem is spared.  At this point Zedekiah does a stupid thing.  He reneges on freeing the slaves.  Those who have been set free are put back into slavery.  The result is quite predictable.  Once again Jeremiah comes forward with a message from the Lord.  He says God’s going to set Zedekiah free in the same way: free to face war and destruction; to face the wrath of God expressed through a foreign king. Nebuchadnezzar will return to Jerusalem to finish what he started.  I don&#8217;t think it’s ever wise to make deals with God.  Sometimes, I think God sees us as we see a child who promises to keep his room clean the rest of his life if we let him stay up to watch a favorite TV show.  We know the child can&#8217;t keep his side of the deal.  In general, though, God expects us to keep our word.  Zedekiah should have stayed with his move to make things right.  In failing to do so, he became, not only a law-breaker once again, but a liar too.<br>
Take Away: The Lord expects us to keep our word.</p>

A lesson on obedience<br>
Jeremiah 35: The descendants&#8230;carried out to the letter what their ancestor commanded.<br>
I don&#8217;t know why it is that Recab&#8217;s son Jonadab ordered his family to become something like monks, but he did.  He told them to never live in permanent buildings and to drink no wine.  For generations his descendants have followed his orders.  Now, with the Babylonian army in the area, the Recabite community has moved into Jerusalem for safety.  The Lord gives Jeremiah an unusual order; he&#8217;s to meet with the Recabites and offer them some wine to drink.  As expected they refuse to drink it, politely explaining that their ancestor forbade it and through the many years since they’ve followed his orders.  The Lord points out to Jeremiah that he has before him a group of people who are carefully following the commands of a mere human being, yet the nation as a whole is steadfastly refusing to follow the commands of God Almighty.  It&#8217;s clear that this passage really has nothing to do with whether or not we drink wine or even whether or not we pay attention to the directions left to us by our ancestors.  Obviously, we have some clear instructions in both the Old and New Testaments to pay attention to the orders of some people.  For instance, children are to obey their parents and citizens are to obey those in authority over them.  However the lesson here for Jeremiah and for us is that, if it&#8217;s reasonable for us to cooperate with mere human beings who have authority over us, it&#8217;s even more reasonable for us to cooperate with what God is doing in our lives.<br>
Take Away: The only reasonable thing is to cooperate with the Lord as he works in our lives.</p>

<p>How inspiration works<br>
Jeremiah 36: There were also generous additions, but the same kind of thing.<br>
Babylon isn&#8217;t the only threat to Judah during Jeremiah&#8217;s ministry.  Egypt also invades and conquers the nation.  Jehoiakim is made king of Judah by the Egyptian conquerors.  It’s during his years in power that the Lord tells Jeremiah to write down a recap of all the prophecies that have been made concerning Israel and Judah.  Jeremiah obeys, dictating his messages to Baruch, who serves as his secretary.  The prophet sends Baruch down to the Temple to read it all to the people and the message creates uproar.  Before long, Baruch, scroll in hand, finds himself before king Jehoiakim.   The king, though, isn&#8217;t impressed with Jeremiah&#8217;s message.  As Baruch reads, the king takes a small knife and trims away each column as it’s heard.  He then, in an act of rejection, throws what has been cut off into the fire.  When Baruch returns to Jeremiah and tells him what’s happened, Jeremiah starts all over again, dictating another message from God, this one more elaborate than the first.  Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot here, but I find myself thinking about how God brought about the Sacred Writings that make up our Bibles.  In this case, God doesn&#8217;t dictate a message to Jeremiah to dictate to Baruch.  Instead, the Lord just tells Jeremiah to write down a summary of all the prophecies he’s given concerning Israel and Judah.  Jeremiah goes to work, dictating to Baruch who faithfully writes down what he hears.  The real kicker to me is that when this process is done a second time, we&#8217;re told that Jeremiah adds some stuff to it.  In other words, there isn&#8217;t just one way for this scroll to be written.  The Lord wants Jeremiah to tell the story, and I have no doubt that the Lord helps Jeremiah remember many specifics.  However, for the second round, Jeremiah wants to add some stuff.  It isn&#8217;t that he’s making things up; he just remembers more and decides to include it.  We have here a pretty neat example of how the Scriptures were given to us.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t dictate word for word (that is, unless it says he did).  Instead, he says, &#8220;write about this event or tell the message you received from me.&#8221;  From there, the writer’s free to frame things in his own words and even from his own perspective.  Because of that we hear from the Scriptures not only the &#8220;big message&#8221; of God&#8217;s intentions, but also the &#8220;little message&#8221; of how the writer views the world.  If you think about it, that&#8217;s a pretty good example of how God works in this world: partnering with humanity and even accepting some of our limitations.<br>
Take Away: The Lord wants us to partner with him in what he’s doing in the world.</p>

Jeremiah’s worst nightmare<br>
Jeremiah 37: Please don&#8217;t send me back to that dungeon.<br>
In this passage, the story of Jeremiah returns to Zedekiah and the attack of the Babylonians.  The prophet has made many enemies with his gloom and doom preaching.  Ultimately, he’s imprisoned on trumped up charges.  The prison he finds himself in is his worst nightmare.  He’s imprisoned in a cistern.  There, we’re told, he stays for a long time.  Jeremiah&#8217;s out of sight, but he isn&#8217;t out of Zedekiah&#8217;s mind.  The king hates Jeremiah&#8217;s sermons, but, somewhere, deep inside himself, he knows that Jeremiah&#8217;s telling the truth.  Finally, Zedekiah sends for Jeremiah and, in spite of his misery, Jeremiah tells the king, not what he might want to hear, but the truth: Judah will fall and Zedekiah will be handed over to the king of Babylon.  Even though the prophet has just given more bad news, Jeremiah pleads with Zedekiah for mercy.  He’s done nothing to bring such inhumane treatment upon himself.  He begs Zedekiah to not send him back to that terrible dungeon.  To his credit the king has mercy on Jeremiah and, while Jeremiah&#8217;s to remain under guard, he&#8217;s put in a better place and given rations for food.  A couple of things come to mind.  First, in spite of his fierce messages, Jeremiah&#8217;s just a man.  He&#8217;s miserable and afraid in the cistern.  He isn&#8217;t too proud to beg for mercy.  Even the spiritual giants in my life are still human and in need of compassion and mercy.  Second, even though Zedekiah&#8217;s deeply flawed, he shows mercy to Jeremiah.  We&#8217;re created in the image of God and that means that from the most unlikely of candidates there&#8217;s the potential of the reflection of his image.<br>
Take Away: Even spiritual giants remain human beings with the accompanying weaknesses and flaws of humanity.</p>

Three cheers for Ebed-melek<br>
Jeremiah 38: Jeremiah sank into the mud.<br>
Jeremiah&#8217;s reprieve from the cistern of Jonathan doesn&#8217;t last.  He&#8217;s more accessible where he&#8217;s being kept in the courtyard of the palace guards so people are coming to him to hear the word of the Lord.  And that&#8217;s just what they hear: being descendants of Abraham doesn&#8217;t make them invulnerable.  The city&#8217;s going to fall and their only hope is to surrender.  When community leaders realize what’s happening they go straight to king Zedekiah, insisting that Jeremiah be silenced.  Once again the king fails as he washes his hands of the situation, handing Jeremiah over to his enemies.  Jonathan&#8217;s cistern was at least dry.  They put the miserable prophet down in Malkijah&#8217;s cistern.  There, we&#8217;re told, &#8220;Jeremiah sank into the mud.&#8221;  One can only imagine the terror of Jeremiah as his feet touch the mud and he begins to sink.  How much mud is there?  Will he suffocate, drowning in mud?  The Lord, though, hasn&#8217;t forgotten his prophet, and the Lord has some loyal people in the city.  One of those people is Ebed-melek.  When he hears what&#8217;s happened to Jeremiah he goes to the king and insists that Jeremiah deserves better treatment.  Once again Zedekiah wavers, this time giving permission to Ebed-melek to take some men and get Jeremiah out of that cistern.  We don&#8217;t know much about Ebed-melek.  He was an Ethiopian, an official in the court, and his name means &#8220;servant of the king.&#8221;  This event causes us to wish we knew him better.  This man suddenly appears on the scene, is used by God at a critical moment in history, and then moves on, never to be seen again.  In the Kingdom there are those who are called to play big roles.  Some are like Jeremiah who stays on the center stage of history for decades.  (This is just an aside, but we shouldn&#8217;t mistake being called to play a big role in God&#8217;s plans to mean we&#8217;ll always like where that role takes us.  Rather, it might be to a terrible place, knee deep in mud.)  The rest of us, though, are given supporting roles.  It may be that our whole lives will be lived in the background, unnoticed by history.  However, we might, at just the right time and place, be given some key lines to say or a fleeting, but important, thing to do.  If that’s what God has in mind for me, I hope I can do my job as well as Ebed-melek does in this passage.<br>
Take Away: We may live our entire lives and only be given one, eternal, history making opportunity.  Let’s make the most of that opportunity when it comes.</p>

Letting it go…gaining it all<br>
Jeremiah 38: I&#8217;m telling you this for your own good.<br>
Zedekiah&#8217;s a pitiful failure.  When it comes to Jeremiah, he keeps him locked up, but can&#8217;t resist talking to him; he hates what he says, but can&#8217;t stop listening.  Once again the prophet&#8217;s being held in the courtyard, and, as things continue to deteriorate, Zedekiah arranges a secret meeting with Jeremiah.  However, he&#8217;s just wasting his time.  At first Jeremiah refuses to answer because he knows Zedekiah won&#8217;t like what he says and will once again refuse to listen to him anyway.  When Zedekiah insists, Jeremiah simply tells him what he&#8217;s told him before: the city will fall and only those who surrender to the invading army will be spared.  Jeremiah is offering Zedekiah the way to life, but he knows Zedekiah will reject it once again.  In the New Testament we find the story of a wealthy young man who comes to Jesus asking the way to life.  When Jesus tells him that the &#8220;way&#8221; is for him to give up everything and become one of his followers the young man sadly turns and walks away.  In the passage before me today I find Zedekiah, like the rich young ruler, rejecting the only hope there is.  How pitiful to be so close and yet so far.  Jeremiah offers Zedekiah hope and Jesus offers the rich young ruler &#8220;life.&#8221;  Both decide to reject what&#8217;s offered in favor of position and wealth and power.  When Jesus, himself, is faced with the same choice he willingly gives up everything and surrenders to his enemies.  This leads to the ordeal of the cross, but it also leads to the resurrection.  So, what are you holding on to that must be released for you to have life?  Today, both Zedekiah and the rich young ruler alike would tell you it is better to let it go because holding on costs too much.<br>
Take Away: Whatever it is that keeps us from the Lord isn’t worth it.</p>

Taking the “rest of the story” by faith<br>
Jeremiah 39: I&#8217;ll most certainly save you.<br>
The hero who rescued Jeremiah from the muddy prison is Ebed-melek.  Now, as Jerusalem totters on the brink of destruction Jeremiah seeks him out.  The Lord has a message specifically for this hero, and it’s a good one.  The Lord has taken note of this good man&#8217;s courage and faithfulness.  Things are going to get really bad very soon but Ebed-melek is going to be spared because God&#8217;s going to see to it.  In a sense, we see here God&#8217;s message to all those who are faithful to him.  There&#8217;s no promise for any of us of an easy life in which bad things never come, but there is the promise of God&#8217;s watch care over us.  It must have been, at the same time, welcome and unbelievable news for Ebed-melek.  Of course, he&#8217;s happy to hear such a message from Jeremiah, God&#8217;s prophet.  At the same time, he, and all Jerusalem, is very aware of the mighty army that&#8217;s poised on their doorstep.  The reality of it all nearly overwhelms the message of assurance from Jeremiah.  It&#8217;s the same for you and me.  The hard facts of pain and disappointment and disaster can nearly obliterate the promise of God&#8217;s presence.  Still, none of that negates it.  Interestingly, the writer of the sacred text doesn&#8217;t follow up on the story.  Jeremiah promises Ebed-melek that God will save him and that&#8217;s it.  Maybe there&#8217;s a lesson for us in what isn&#8217;t included here.  We&#8217;re to read this promise and conclude that, even though we don&#8217;t know the details, God keeps his word.  In the same way, I, right in the middle of life without any specific knowledge of what&#8217;s coming, must conclude that God will &#8220;most certainly save&#8221; me too.<br>
Take Away: Even we don’t know how he’s going to do it we can rest assured that the Lord will, indeed, keep his promises.</p>

Kindness from an unexpected source<br>
Jeremiah 40: The captain of the bodyguard singled out Jeremiah.<br>
Jerusalem falls.  Jeremiah doesn&#8217;t give us the details, just that it happened as the Lord had said it would.  Jeremiah is put in chains and included in the mass relocation program that&#8217;s the policy of the conquering Babylonians.  However, when the commanding officer, Nebuzharadan surveys his captives, he takes note of Jeremiah.  This heathen military man knows the story.  He knows that Jeremiah has, for years, been warning his people that all this was coming.  Nebuzharadan declares Jeremiah free.  He can travel to Babylon as his guest or he can return to Jerusalem.  He even goes so far as to encourage Jeremiah to go to the vassal king, Gedaliah, who has been put into power over Judah.  I find it interesting that God&#8217;s man is shown more respect by a heathen captain than he was given by the now as good as dead Zedekiah, king of Judah and descendant of David.  Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t be greatly surprised at this because it&#8217;s a fairly common occurrence.  For instance, when the Savior is born, &#8220;wise men from the east&#8221; come to honor him.  They get directions from the experts in Jerusalem, but those same experts aren&#8217;t themselves interested in making the short jaunt to Bethlehem.  Here&#8217;s my take on this today: sometimes God&#8217;s people aren&#8217;t as much God&#8217;s people as they think they are and sometimes lost people aren&#8217;t as lost as we might think.<br>
Take Away: The Lord works though some unlikely people, especially when the “likely ones” aren’t up to the task.</p>

Gedaliah’s last supper<br>
Jeremiah 41: His ten men jumped to their feet and knocked Gedaliah down and killed him.<br>
You&#8217;d think that people would be weary of the bloodshed; that they&#8217;d consider themselves fortunate to now be on the back side of the Babylonian storm.  However, it isn&#8217;t that way.  Ishmael is a member of the royal family who escaped deportation and now he has his eye on the throne.  The Babylonian-appointed governor, Gedaliah, welcomes those who had fled the siege of Jerusalem, apparently thinking the best of everyone.  However, in doing so, he brings the traitor Ishmael right into his fold.  It’s not that he isn&#8217;t warned about Ishmael, in fact, Johanan wants to do away with him right off, knowing he&#8217;ll destabilize the fragile state of Judah.  Gedaliah is having none of that, in fact, he invites Ishmael and his men to come to, what turns out to be Gedaliah&#8217;s last meal.  As I read about Gedaliah&#8217;s short tenure as governor of Judah I&#8217;m reminded of the instructions of Jesus to his disciples to be &#8220;as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.&#8221;  In this passage, we have the shrewd Johanan who knows Ishmael means nothing but trouble.  His solution is to knock him off.  On the other hand we have the innocent Gedaliah who makes no provision for his own protection and pays for his wide-eyed innocence with his life.  We Christians are supposed take the best from both of these men.  We need to know the score, to be shrewd in how we go about living our lives.  At the same time, we&#8217;re to do no intentional harm.  I don&#8217;t have to scheme to do away with my enemies, but I don&#8217;t have to hand them my wallet either.<br>
Take Away: As the people of the Lord we’re to use graceful and merciful common sense.</p>

Some things are easier said than done<br>
Jeremiah 42: I&#8217;m on your side, ready to save and deliver you from anything he might do.<br>
Johanan and other Judean leaders know that the murder of Gedaliah is a very big deal.  The Babylonian king is not known for his forgiving nature.  Gedaliah was the person he left in charge and his murder will be seen as an uprising against his rule.  There’s sure to be devastating punishment.  Their solution is to prepare for exile by running in the opposite direction to Egypt, the other major power in the region.  Johanan and others ask Jeremiah to pray for God&#8217;s direction in this, promising to do whatever the Lord says.  However, the message from the Lord isn’t what they expect to hear.  The Lord says to stay put and trust him.  Again, this is totally unexpected and, from a human point of view, very unreasonable.  They&#8217;ve already seen the wrath of the Babylonians.  Thousands have been killed, multiplied thousands have been carried off into exile never to return, and devastation is all around them.  For civic leaders to stick around, waiting for word of the governor&#8217;s murder to reach Babylonia is, in their eyes, an almost criminal inaction.  Jeremiah says, &#8220;Just trust God and everything will be okay.&#8221;  That&#8217;s one of those &#8220;easier said than done&#8221; statements.  Happily, such extreme, life and death situations don&#8217;t come our way very often, if ever.  For me to find applications in life I have to dial things back considerably.  Still, there are times when we, too, are to stand still and trust God rather than take matters into our own hands.  For instance, things down at the church may not be going well and several are jumping ship for the latest and greatest program down the road.  We&#8217;re tempted to follow suit, but when we pray, we simply can&#8217;t feel free to do it.  Others say, &#8220;Come on in, the water&#8217;s fine!&#8221;  God seems to say, &#8220;Stay right where you are, I&#8217;ll take care of you and your family.&#8221;  As a pastor it always concerns me when church people from other congregations show up at our door on a Sunday morning.  I&#8217;m not saying there&#8217;s never a time to go, but I don&#8217;t want to be someone&#8217;s &#8220;Egypt&#8221; when the Lord wants them to stay put and be a part of the turning of the tide right where they are.<br>
Take Away: If the Lord says “stay put” the only thing to do is, well, to stay put!</p>

God’s direction or just his blessing?<br>
Jeremiah 43: Liar! Our God never sent you with this message.<br>
It starts when Johanan and others come to Jeremiah asking him to pray as they decide on their course of action.  It won&#8217;t be long before the king of Babylon hears of the murder of the governor he appointed over their territory and they want to get out of town before he comes to finish the destruction that was started when Jerusalem fell.  They promise that they&#8217;ll do whatever God says.  Jeremiah agrees to go to the Lord for a plan of action but the instructions he receives from the Lord surprises everyone, maybe even the prophet, himself.  God says stay put and he&#8217;ll take care of them.  That doesn&#8217;t sit well with any of the leaders.  You see, they don&#8217;t really want God&#8217;s direction.  Instead, they want God&#8217;s blessing on what they’ve already decided to do.  When Jeremiah returns with a word from God that contradicts their plans they immediately declare Jeremiah to be a liar who has an agenda of his own.  In spite of dire warnings from him they load everyone up and head for Egypt&#8230;and for more destruction.  I&#8217;m glad I never make the mistake Johanan and the others did and ignore the &#8220;asking for directions&#8221; part and leap directly to the &#8220;Lord, bless what I&#8217;m about to do&#8221; part.   Well, at least I know how it&#8217;s supposed to work.  Maybe one of the reasons I end up in &#8220;Egypt&#8221; so often is that I spent all my prayer time explaining to the Lord why he ought to bless my predetermined course of action instead of asking him what it is, exactly, he wants me to do in the first place.<br>
Take Away: Do we really want the Lord’s directions or just his rubber stamp on what we what to do?</p>

Looking into the future<br>
Jeremiah 43: He&#8217;ll set up his throne on the very stones I&#8217;ve had buried here.<br>
I don&#8217;t believe that the future is mapped out in detail because I firmly believe God has given us the gift, and responsibility, of free will.  However, I certainly believe that some things about the future are preordained.  It isn&#8217;t that the Lord has looked into the future and seen things happening; it&#8217;s just that he&#8217;s Sovereign and he&#8217;s declared he&#8217;s going to bring certain things to pass.  When the Almighty says he&#8217;s going to do something, that&#8217;s just as sure as if it already happened.  In this passage we find Jeremiah in Egypt.  I&#8217;m not sure why Johanan and the others brought him along.  Apparently, it&#8217;s similar to why King Zedekiah kept Jeremiah locked up but couldn&#8217;t resist going to him for the latest word from the Lord.  Jeremiah&#8217;s message to them is unwavering.  The Lord said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go to Egypt&#8221; and they&#8217;ve gone to Egypt anyway.  The Lord said, &#8220;If you go to Egypt you&#8217;ll find the death and destruction you&#8217;re fleeing.&#8221;  Now, Jeremiah drives that point home by having some stones laid along the walkway that leads to one of Pharaoh&#8217;s palaces.  He says that the day&#8217;s coming when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will sit his throne right on top of those stones as he claims the gem of Egypt for Babylon.  Again, I don&#8217;t see every detail of the future as predetermined.  Still, there&#8217;s plenty that God has already declared to be certain.  For instance, Jesus is coming back, Judgment day is sure, and everyone will spend forever somewhere.  I have the freedom to prepare for those certainties or not, as my future isn’t predetermined.  By the grace of God that much is up to me and my eternity hangs in the balance based on that decision.<br>
Take Away: Certain things about the future are sure but how I respond to the grace of God in preparing for that future he leaves to me.</p>

Walk like an Egyptian<br>
Jeremiah 44:  The good is gone.<br>
The survivors of the destruction of Jerusalem not only flee to Egypt, they embrace the idol worshipping culture of their nation of refuge too.  It isn&#8217;t that big a step.  They were already toying with such things before, although before fleeing Jerusalem they had kept a dash of Jehovah worship mixed in with their religious practices.  Now that Jerusalem&#8217;s destroyed and they&#8217;ve deserted that place they think they&#8217;re free from God Almighty too.  They embrace all things Egyptian.  The popular thing to do is &#8220;walk like an Egyptian.&#8221;  Meanwhile, God&#8217;s anger toward them increases.  Back in Judea when everyone else was either being killed off or carried off to live the rest of their lives in Babylonian exile these people had been spared.  &#8220;Blest&#8221; is probably too strong a word, but it&#8217;s clear that they were treated less harshly than were their fellow Israelites.  Their response: run the opposite direction, away from their homeland and away from their God.  So, again, God&#8217;s fed up with them.  If they like Egypt so well, they can have it along with the judgment that&#8217;s coming to that land.  God says to them, &#8220;It&#8217;s all over; I have nothing good left for you.&#8221;   I&#8217;m not a gloom and doom preacher but passages like this concern me.  We Christians are so quick to embrace the current cultural fads.  We&#8217;re entertained by the same things, buy into the same materialistic values, and, in general, fit into the broken culture of our day.  The Lord tells those who fled to Egypt that, if they like Egypt so well, he’ll treat them as he&#8217;s going to treat the Egyptians.  Maybe we Christians ought to think twice before we get too carried away with &#8220;walking like an Egyptian.&#8221;<br>
Take Away: We’re in the world but we’re not to be of the world.</p>

A personal promise from the Lord<br>
Jeremiah 45: I&#8217;ll keep you alive through the whole business.<br>
The story of Jeremiah pretty much ends with him in Egypt.  Aside from the conclusion to his writings in the last pages of the book we&#8217;re about to move to an &#8220;appendix&#8221; of some of his prophecies concerning other nations.  Just before we do that, we find the brief words of chapter 45.  Obviously, this is out of place and would fit better back in chapter 36.  It&#8217;s in that chapter that we find the story of Jeremiah&#8217;s dictating his gloom and doom message to his loyal secretary, Baruch.  This good man writes it all down, not once, but twice.  Baruch, then, is very aware of what&#8217;s coming, and frankly that knowledge scares him to death.  The king might deny it all and act to silence the messenger.  Baruch, though, believes every word he’s written.  In an act of mercy, Jeremiah informs his faithful secretary that now he has a message specifically for him.  God&#8217;s word for this good man is this: &#8220;Things are going to get worse, but don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to take care of you and see you through this whole business.&#8221;  I can just imagine Baruch&#8217;s blood pressure dropping several points as Jeremiah states these words of assurance to him.  I can&#8217;t find any prophecies in the Bible with my name on them, but I do find plenty of promises addressed to those who put their trust in the Lord.  Like Baruch, then, I have a word from the Lord to hold on to even when things are in the &#8220;getting worse&#8221; stage.  I don&#8217;t have to be consumed with worry because God has promised life to me.<br>
Take Away: It’s a great comfort in troubling times to remember that the Lord has promised life to me.</p>

A lesson in humility<br>
Jeremiah 49: I, God, say so, and it will be so.<br>
Chapters 46 through 51 of Jeremiah are a compilation of prophecies Jeremiah gives about the nations of the region.  Clearly, the Almighty is interested in more people than just those of Israel.  He&#8217;s been paying close attention to the downward spiral of the region and is about to shake everything up.  Clearly, this isn&#8217;t as drastic as the Flood was in Noah&#8217;s day, but it is a remaking of this entire region.  Jeremiah writes it all out as poetry: awful, frightening words put to verse.  It&#8217;s in the message to the Ammonites that I find the phrase, &#8220;I, God, say so, and it will be so.&#8221;  To me, that pretty much sums up these painful-to-read chapters.  This is an aspect of the Lord that makes me uncomfortable.  Frankly, I don&#8217;t like these chapters.  Then again, I don&#8217;t have to.  Sovereign God, the Giver of Life, surely has the authority to be the Taker of Life.  What he does along these lines is on his side of the equation, not mine.  He doesn&#8217;t have to explain himself to me and I don&#8217;t have to like how it all works out.  I find some consolation in the fact that the very words I read today are warnings to these nations, given before the fact.  In theory, at least, their turning to God might have resulted in a display of his mercy.  Instead, these people live evil lives and are addicted to cruelty.  In bringing Judgment on this region the Almighty is acting unilaterally and he doesn&#8217;t need my approval and support.  Today as I remember who God is and who I am I find myself learning a lesson in humility.<br>
Take Away: When the Lord acts according to his own Sovereignty we can simply accept it – after all he doesn’t need our understanding, permission, or approval.</p>
