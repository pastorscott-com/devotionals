Put God first<br />
Proverbs 1: Start with God.<br />
The Bible tells us about God and about ourselves.  Many of its pages contain a history of God and us, telling us not only where we have been but God&#8217;s desire for us in the future.  However, there’s more than even that.  The Lord doesn&#8217;t just want all of us to go to heaven when we die.  Rather, he wants us to live the best lives possible in the here and now.  That&#8217;s what the book of Proverbs is about.  These wise sayings aren&#8217;t written to tell us our history and they aren&#8217;t written to point to way to heaven.  They tell us how to live the wisest way today.  So, as we begin to read this collection of insights into life we’re immediately given the foundational secret: &#8220;Start with God &#8212; the first step in learning is bowing down to God.&#8221;  Theoretically, I might get everything else right, but if I miss this number one concept before long it will all tumble down.  Wisdom begins with God and because of that the satisfied, complete life starts here too.  Jesus says it this way, &#8220;Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well&#8221; (Matthew 6:33).<br />
Take Away: When we build our lives around the Lord we have the potential of building a rich, satisfying life…“Start with God.”</p>

Grabbing the gusto, looking to eternity<br />
Proverbs 1: When you grab all you can get, that&#8217;s when it happens: the more you get, the less you have.<br />
As I read this passage I can&#8217;t help but think of the beer commercial that tells us we only go &#8217;round once in life so we&#8217;d better grab all the gusto we can.  I actually think there’s some truth to that.  Life is a gift of God filled with many wonderful opportunities and blessings.  I can&#8217;t sit around talking about &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; and get the most out of my life.  There&#8217;s a lot of living to do right now.  The wise man of the Proverbs, though, gives me the other side of that coin.  If I make my life completely about living in the here and now, ignoring all that is yet to come, well, I&#8217;m setting myself up for a great fall.  Life is more than &#8220;right now.&#8221;  This life might be considered to be a warm up for eternity.  So, grabbing the gusto can make sense, but that approach must be kept on a leash and not allowed to just run wild because there’s much more to our existence than just going &#8217;round once.  Or, as Jesus says in Matthew 6:20, &#8220;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.&#8221;<br />
Take Away: One way to live the best life possible in the here and now is to live with an eye on eternity.</p>

Learning to listen<br />
Proverbs 3: Listen for God&#8217;s voice in everything you do, everywhere you go.<br />
We tend to think that hearing from God is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or maybe that it’s something only saints on earth experience.  It isn&#8217;t true.  The Lord created us for fellowship with himself.  From the beginning he walked with Adam in the cool of the day.  I don&#8217;t have to do some extreme thing to hear from God.  All I have to do is listen.  But that&#8217;s a problem isn&#8217;t it?  Hearing the Voice of God in the ordinary flow of life takes practice.  If I want to hear him speak when I’m sitting in the emergency room of a hospital or when a precious friend is pouring his heart out to me seeking spiritual council I have to practice listening for him when I’m not in the pressure cooker of life.  I&#8217;m certain that God speaks, and that he does so constantly.  Sadly, I am also sure that I’m not a very good listener.  For this proverb to work for me; for me to listen for God&#8217;s voice everywhere I go, I need to practice the presence of God every day.  The way to accomplish that is for me to discipline myself to meet God by creating quiet places in life where I can learn to hear his Voice.  Then, when I&#8217;m out there in the &#8220;everywhere you go&#8221; part of life, I will have trained my spiritual ear to recognize the Master&#8217;s Voice.<br />
Take Away: It takes practice to learn to hear the Voice of God in the noisy situations of life.</p>

God’s the cook, I’m just a waiter<br />
Proverbs 3: Never walk away from someone who deserves help; your hand is God&#8217;s hand for that person.<br />
The highest honor in life is to work with God in what he’s doing in the world.  It’s amazing to realize that the Almighty, the Creator of the Universe, will call on me to assist him in some manner.  Jesus uses his disciples to assist him in performing miracles.  For instance, when he feeds the 5000 he uses them as waiters who distribute the food.  Obviously, transforming a sack lunch into a truck load of food is the biggest part, but the disciples are pressed into service, assisting in the miracle.  The wise man of the Proverbs reminds me that I ought to be aware of the needs I encounter in life and realize that God will use me as his assistant to meet those needs.  I know that he doesn&#8217;t have to have my help.  After all, he could rain down manna from heaven.  However, I also know that he invites me into partnership with himself.  Again, the highest honor in life is to be invited to labor with God.<br />
Take Away: How might the Lord use me, in even some small minor way, to assist him in his purposes today?</p>

How’s your heart doing?<br />
Proverbs 4: Keep vigilant watch over your heart; that&#8217;s where life starts.<br />
I try to keep an eye on my weight and sometimes I do a better job at it than I do at other times.  I also pay attention to my bank account.  Each month I take time to balance my checkbook and, while I’m no expert at it, I watch my retirement account, trying to do what’s prudent with it.  There are lots of things to watch: maintenance on the car, paying the electric bill, mowing the lawn.  The wise man of the Proverbs reminds me to keep an eye on my heart.  Of course, he isn&#8217;t talking about lowering cholesterol.  It’s the spiritual heart he’s talking about.  I want to be sure I keep my heart centered on the Lord and to know that, as I seek him and his Kingdom, other things will take care of themselves.  It isn&#8217;t that I’m to neglect watching my weight and my bank account, it’s that all else functions in my life as it should only when my heart is right with the Lord.<br />
Take Away: It’s not a bad idea to do a “spiritual checkup” once in a while…just to keep an eye on things.</p>

Looking at life “backwards”<br />
Proverbs 4: Keep your eyes straight ahead; ignore all sideshow distractions.<br />
When the proverb writer advises us to ignore all the distractions of life he’s just stating common sense but, obviously, it’s something easier said than done.  For instance, before I can focus on the goal I have to know what that goal is.  Right off the voices of the snake oil huskers begin selling me their bill of goods.  They tell me that whatever they’re selling is just the thing I should give my life to.  Some of the offers contain just enough truth to sound right.  I’m reminded of all the sports leagues that demand so much of a families&#8217; time.  There’s a great deal of good happening in such activities, but, honestly, they aren&#8217;t worth committing one&#8217;s life to and they sure don&#8217;t deserve the status they’re given in many families.  So what is it that’s worthy of my focus?  I think the answer can be found by looking at life &#8220;backwards.&#8221;  When I’m at the end of my life, when they’re closing the lid on my coffin, what will matter?  I say it’s my relationship with God.  Of course, other things will matter: family, friends, and how I’ve impacted the world in my brief life.  However, eternity is, well, forever.  The goal of life has to be to prepare for forever.  With that in mind, I can read this proverb and better identify not only what truly matters, but what needs to be kept in its proper place as well.<br />
Take Away: How are you doing in preparing for forever?</p>

Don’t play with fire<br />
Proverbs 6: Can you build a fire in your lap and not burn your pants?<br />
King Solomon is credited with writing Proverbs.  I guess a man married to as many women as he was either knows a lot about women or nothing at all about them!  I&#8217;ll give him credit for knowing a lot about life in what he says about extramarital affairs.  In some ways his comments on this topic that cover the greater part of three chapters of Proverbs are out of date.  His picturing the man as some foolish, gullible fellow being seduced by some worldly woman seems out of date to me.  I&#8217;m not saying that never happens, but it’s just as common for the shoe to be on the other foot and it’s the female who is fed a line.  In fact, I have the idea that often it’s both who are victims of an entertainment media and popular culture that treats sexual intimacy as something far less than was intended by God when he gave it to us as a wonderful gift.  However, if I think Solomon is rather narrow when he focuses only the young man as the gullible one, he’s right on when it comes to the consequences.  The loose lifestyle causes terrible emotional pain.  Couples think they’re entering into &#8220;no fault&#8221; relationships, and when one is ready to call it quits they’ll both just move on.  It never works that way.  Both are cheapened by the experience.  They’ll never know the depth of what might have been.  Our society has been sold a bill of goods that’s supposed to be freeing and fulfilling.  Instead, to use Solomon&#8217;s description, many are being burned and will spend a lifetime dealing with the scars of their so called freedom.<br />
Take Away: Despite what culture says, God’s way is still the best way.</p>

My most precious gift<br />
Proverbs 8: Don&#8217;t squander your precious life.<br />
Proverbs eight and nine contain an imaginary conversation with &#8220;Lady Wisdom.&#8221;  She offers us all kinds of advice as well as shares her lofty credentials.  My favorite statement from her is &#8220;don&#8217;t squander your precious life.&#8221;  Some things I think are valuable are like counterfeit money; not worth the paper it’s printed on.  The day will come when someone will sift through all of my &#8220;valuables&#8221; deciding what&#8217;s worth passing on and what needs to go out to the curb to await a trip to the land fill.  I&#8217;m pretty sure most of it will come up short.  Sadly, we’re all prone to spend our lives chasing after things that prove to be worthless when all is said and done.  Today, as I read these words I remember that life is precious indeed; an amazing and undeserved gift from God.  Every breath is to be prized and great care should be taken to not waste it.  I don&#8217;t want to live my life in pursuit of worthless things, spending my most valuable resource foolishly.  On the other hand, I can use up my life in a quest of excellence.  The question I must ask myself is, &#8220;How can I best live my life and spend this, my most precious gift?&#8221;<br />
Take Away: How can I best live my life?</p>

The greater part of the book of Proverbs is made up of wise &#8220;one-liners.&#8221;  Well, they’re actually &#8220;two-liners&#8221; that follow the format &#8220;This does this, but that does that.&#8221;  One of the many wonderful strengths of &#8220;The Message&#8221; is how beautifully Peterson handles the parables, giving them new life for his readers.  Today, I’m reminded that all the good things in life come from the Lord.  He’s the &#8220;Blesser&#8221; giving us so much to enjoy.  One of the lies of the Garden of Eden is that people can pull themselves up to God&#8217;s level and thus &#8220;bless themselves&#8221; in doing things their own way.  The truth is that nothing I do on my own to create a satisfied, happy life equals what God can do for me.  Getting my own way won&#8217;t give me a rich life.  Instead, I’ll have spent my assets on a bag of worthless rocks.  It’s only when I realize that God is the only One who can make my life worth living and that he desires to do just that that I have a hope of living the &#8220;rich life.&#8221;  Sometimes, I have to simply accept God&#8217;s blessings in a sincere spirit of thanksgiving and not try to do it my own way.<br />
Take Away: When the Lord blesses me the proper response is to say “thank you” and then go about enjoying the blessing.</p>

God and me<br />
Proverbs 11: The more wise counsel you follow, the better your chances.<br />
Western culture exalts the individual.  In the words of the song, &#8220;best of all, I did it my way.&#8221;  We like our independence.  It&#8217;s true even in our religion.  We Protestants don&#8217;t have a pope and we don&#8217;t even want the church to tell us what to believe.  Instead, we prefer &#8220;us and God&#8221; &#8212; an approach that can often be more truthfully stated, &#8220;Me.&#8221;  We don&#8217;t have a pope, but when we’re honest with ourselves, we like it when we can be our own pope: &#8220;I&#8217;ll get my Bible and decide for myself what it says.&#8221;  Now, I know that there are some positive aspects to this.  After all, the &#8220;protestors&#8221; who became the &#8220;Protestants&#8221; did have something to protest about.  Still, doing religion &#8220;my way&#8221; isn’t necessarily an improvement.  Doing it &#8220;my way&#8221; leads to aberrations of doctrine.  Walking down the &#8220;me&#8221; road isn&#8217;t the road to God.  In fact, it’s the original path away from God that’s described in the opening pages of our Bibles.  Learning to listen to others and even being willing to submit to the authority of those who the larger body of believers has recognized to be uniquely prepared and gifted to lead will, in the words of the proverb &#8220;better your chances&#8221; of staying on the right road to God.<br />
Take Away: “Me and God” quite often is really just “me.”</p>
